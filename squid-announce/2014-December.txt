The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.4.10 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Bug 4033: Rebuild corrupted ssl_db/size file

The certificate DB size file may become empty (for reasons beyond Squid
control such as server reboots, and possibly some unknown Squid bugs).
When it becomes empty, all ssl_crtd helpers (and then Squid) quit.


* Fixes Segmentation Fault in ACLUrlPathStrategy::match

This segmentation fault would occur when urlpath_regex ACL was used in
access controls to test transactions where no URL path is available.
 eg CONNECT or OPTIONS requests, some WebDAV requests, etc.


* Fixes Alternate-Protocol header behaviour

Certain servers emit the non-standard Alternate-Protocol header
without listing it as Connection header and popular client software
will attempt to follow its instructions regardless of the presence of
a proxy. This may result in loss of administrative information about
client traffic, increased network bandwidth, unpredictable client
failures, loss of connectivity for the client, information leakage
and/or other security vulnerabilities in experimental protocols.

Squid now handles this non-standard header on the clients behalf and
will cause it to only have any effect if the protocol it instructs to
be used is supported by Squid.


 All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade to this release as
time permits.



 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.4

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.

The Squid Software Foundation is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid-3.5.0.4 beta release!


This release is a bug fix and documentation update release resolving
some major issues found in the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:

* Support http_access denials of SslBump "peeked" connections.

This bug shows up with "peek" SSL-Bump operation preventing Squid from
rejecting client connections, and "splice" connections not being
governed by the general access controls.

Starting with this release ssl_bump has the following behaviours:

- - During transparent SSL bumping, if we decide to splice at step1, do
not splice the connection immediately, but create a fake CONNECT
request first and send it through the callout code (http_access check,
ICAP/ECAP, etc.). If that fake CONNECT is denied, the code path
described below kicks in. Otherwise the connection is spliced.

- - When an error page is generated during CONNECT or transparent
bumping (e.g. because an http_access check has failed), we switch to
the "client-first" bumping mode and then serve the error page to the
client (upon receiving the first regular request on the bumped
connection).


* negotiate_kerberos_auth: MEMORY keytab and replay cache support

The Negotiate/Kerberos authentication helper has been updated to
support a MEMORY: keytab. This provides better performance over
previous versions with constant disk access.

Also, the token replay cache is now more configurable. It may be moved
from the default location as needed, or disabled entirely.



* Bug 3826: pt 2: Provide a systemd .service file for Squid

Squid is designed with a built-in daemon manager which clashes in
annoying ways with third-party daemon managers like OpenRC, Upstart,
and systemd. In particular Squid SMP support is not fully operational
under these systems.

This release provides a squid.service file under tools/ for anyone
wishing to package Squid for the systemd environment. It contains
basic signalling rules and command line arguments suitable for
managing this version of Squid via systemd (without SMP support).


* Code style reformatting

Our code style enforcement was not working properly since the Sept
2014 server outage. That has been fixed and along with it several old
bugs in the enforcement code. As a result this release includes a
large amount of style/polishing changes. It is very likely that
patches written for older releases 3.5 will need adjusting.


* Bug fixes shared with 3.4 series

This release also includes several bug fixes shared with the 3.4 stable
series in future 3.4.11 release.


All users of previous 3.5 releases are urged to upgrade to this releas
as soon as possible.

All users of 3.4 and older versions are encouraged to give this Squid
release a test run as soon as time permits. All feedback welcome.
