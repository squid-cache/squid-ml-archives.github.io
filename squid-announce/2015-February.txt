The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.4.12 release!


This release is a security fix release resolving several major issues
found in the prior Squid releases.

    REMINDER: This and older releases are already deprecated by
              Squid-3.5 availablility.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Bug #3997: Excessive NTLM or Negotiate auth helper annotations

This bug appears whenever NTLM or Negotiate authentication are taking
place. On a busy server the outward appearance is excessive CPU usage
and associated loss of performance, a memory "leak" may also be seen
depending on the size of authentication token. This state appears at
the worst possible moments when users are busy, and disappears some
time after users stop accessing the proxy.

Deepest apologies that this took so long to pin down, and a great
big Thank You to Steve Hill for tracking it down in the end.


* Bug #4066: Digest auth nonce indefinite rollover

This bug prevented the backend authentication system being contacted
to re-verify user credentials after their TTL has expired. Making it
near impossible to kick off an active user by closing their account or
changing password.

Please note that while this does have a security impact it is NOT
being considerd for an advisory with CVE rating since the user has to
properly authenticate before they can abuse this.

A big Thank You to Frederic Bourgeois for tracking this one down.


* Set cap_net_admin capability when Squid sets TOS/Diffserv packet values.

This bug was behind the strange behaviour on some installations where
TOS/Diffserv packet markings were not being performed despite explicit
configuration. Squid is now retaining the needed security permissions.


* Add TLS/SSL option NO_TICKET to http[s]_port

Squid now supports configuration of the TLS session ticket extension.
Specifically disabling it in situations where its undesirable to allow
OpenSSL the feature.




 All users are encouraged to upgrade to the 3.5 series.

 All users of older 3.4 are urged to upgrade to this release as soon
as possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.4

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.2 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Regression Bug #4176: Digest auth too many helper lookups

It was found that the Digest authentication helper was being called to
validate credentials on every client request regardless of an
appropriate TTL or nonce re-use counter being available.

This release decreases CPU usage and improves latency of client
traffic on all installations using Digest authentication.


* SSL-Bump feature transparency improvements

The SSL-Bump feature is now relaying SNI information from the client
to server when performing server-first bumping of intercepted traffic.

The sslproxy_options directive is now no longer being applied to
server connections when peek/stare operations are performed.

Squid will now supply to the external verification helper the missing
root CAs (i.e. fill in the gaps) when validating chains that already
passed internal checks.

Each of these reduces TLS errors induced by the existence of Squid in
the path, making SSL-Bump much more transparent than before.


* Fix some cbdataFree related memory leaks

This resolves some slow memory leaks resulting from the use of
cache_peer. Be aware there are other issues still outstanding which
have the appearance of memory leaks in some installations. If you are
seeing what appears to be a leak this may help, but it also may not be
the whole issue.


* All security fixes from 3.4.12 are also present in this release.



 All users of Squid SSL-Bump feature are urged to upgrade to this
release as soon as possible.

 All users of NTLM or Negotiate (Kerberos) authentication features are
urged to upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

 All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade to this release as soon as
possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
