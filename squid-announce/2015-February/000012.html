Hash: SHA1

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.2 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Regression Bug #4176: Digest auth too many helper lookups

It was found that the Digest authentication helper was being called to
validate credentials on every client request regardless of an
appropriate TTL or nonce re-use counter being available.

This release decreases CPU usage and improves latency of client
traffic on all installations using Digest authentication.


* SSL-Bump feature transparency improvements

The SSL-Bump feature is now relaying SNI information from the client
to server when performing server-first bumping of intercepted traffic.

The sslproxy_options directive is now no longer being applied to
server connections when peek/stare operations are performed.

Squid will now supply to the external verification helper the missing
root CAs (i.e. fill in the gaps) when validating chains that already
passed internal checks.

Each of these reduces TLS errors induced by the existence of Squid in
the path, making SSL-Bump much more transparent than before.


* Fix some cbdataFree related memory leaks

This resolves some slow memory leaks resulting from the use of
cache_peer. Be aware there are other issues still outstanding which
have the appearance of memory leaks in some installations. If you are
seeing what appears to be a leak this may help, but it also may not be
the whole issue.


* All security fixes from 3.4.12 are also present in this release.



 All users of Squid SSL-Bump feature are urged to upgrade to this
release as soon as possible.

 All users of NTLM or Negotiate (Kerberos) authentication features are
urged to upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

 All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade to this release as soon as
possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
