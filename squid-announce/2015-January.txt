The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.4.11 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* "Deleting first fs left psstate->servers pointing to uninitialized
memory"

This obscurely named bug takes the appearance of randomly appearing
high CPU consumption and hanging worker, less commonly a direct crash.
It is not the only cause of overly high CPU usage, but is the major
one now known about in 3.4 series.

This affects all Squid configured with a large number of peers or when
contacting domains with many advertised IP addresses (such as Google
or Facebook).


* Bug #3760: squidclient ignores --disable-ipv6

The squidclient tool would mysteriously attempt to use IPv6 and abort
regardless of IP version probles successfully detecting that protocol
being disabled.

It turns out that Squid has not been correctly filtering out IPv6
results presented by the operating system getaddrinfo() API in the
event that the administrator disabled IPv6 in Squid but not the
operating sytem.

This affects DNS resolution of all domain names when starting and
configuring Squid, but not for regular proxy operational DNS queries.


* Bug #4057: Avoid on-exit crashes when adaptation is enabled.

As the name describes, Squid 3.4.5 and later will crash when shutting
down (or reconfiguring) if adpatation is configued.


* Bug #3754: configure doesnt detect IPFilter 5.1.2 system headers

The Solaris 10 operating system broken IPFilter, both the one built
into Solaris 10 and the publicly available external sources for the tools.

This Squid release includes a hack to workaround that system breakage
and allow Squids part of the IPFilter mechanisms to build and work again.



 All users of Squid are urged to upgrade to this release as soon as
possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.4

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.1 release!


This release is we believe, stable enough for general production use.

Support for Squid-3.4 bug fixes has now officially ceased. Bugs in 3.4
will continue to be fixed, however the fixes will be added to the 3.5
series. All users of Squid-3.4 are encouraged to plan for upgrades.


A short list of the major new features is:

 * Collapsed Forwarding (ported from Squid-2.7)
 * eCAP version 1.0 support
 * SSL peek-n-splice
 * Authentication helper query extensions (see auth_param)
 * Caching large (>32KB) objects in Rock storage
 * Extended cache HIT/MISS decision control (see send_hit, store_miss)
 * Support named services
 * Upgraded squidclient tool
 * Helper support for concurrency channels
 * Native FTP protocol relay
 * Initial support for PROXY protocol
 * Basic authentication MSNT helper changes

Several features have been removed in 3.5:

 * COSS storage type has been superceded by Rock storage type.
 * dnsserver helper has been superceded by DNS internal client.
 * DNS helper API has been superceded by DNS internal client.

Further details can be found in the release notes or the wiki.
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-3.5


Please be aware that for the SSL-Bump peek-n-splice feature the
ssl_bump directive configuration has changed. Some testers have found
it may require manual attention to redesign the bumping configuratio
on upgrade. Squid does perform auto-upgrade as best it can, but the
result may not meet the intended policy behaviour.
 http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump/


Please remember to run "squid -k parse" when testing upgrade to a new
version of Squid. It will audit your configuration files and report
any identifiable issues the new release will have in your installation
before you "press go".

Squid is beginning to enforce stricter configuration file syntax and
case sensitivity in 3.5.


All feature additions are considered *experimental* until they have
survived at least one series of releases in general production use.
Please be aware of that when rolling out features which are new in
this series. Not all use-cases have been well tested yet and some may
not even have been implemented. Assistance is still needed despite the
releases general stability level.


Plans for the next series of releases is already well underway. Our
future release plans and upcoming features can be found at:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/RoadMap/Squid3


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

 All users of Squid-3.5 beta releases are urged to upgrade to this
release as soon as possible.

It means the max-size= parameter of rock cache_dir may now be a value
larger than 32KB if you need it.

Rock is still optimized for small objects, so making max-size=N a very
large value will produce a slow down in performance unless also tuning
the slot size parameter to reduce slot count per object.
