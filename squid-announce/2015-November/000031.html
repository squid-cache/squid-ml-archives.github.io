<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.11 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving issues found in the prior
Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Regression Bug #4279: FTP-download of non-existing file

When requested to fetch an <A HREF="ftp://">ftp://</A> URL for a file which does not exist
earlier Squid would simply hang. An appropriate error page is now
generated and delivered to the client.



* Bug #4347: compile errors with LibreSSL 2.3

LibreSSL 2.3 removed SSLv3 support entirely from its API. Meaning
Squid-3.5 would no longer build with SSL enabled. That is now resolved,
with SSLv3 being made optional in Squid.

OpenSSL allowed builds with SSLv3 removed as well, though this is less
common it also would have the same effect on Squid builds.

NP: since 3.5.11 packaging one related issue has been found that can
result in assert(0) on some CPU architectures.



* Bug #3574: crashes on reconfigure and startup

During machine boot sequence Squid can receive multiple reconfigure
signals during its startup phase as the system configuration is changed
and Squid signalled to reload the information.Leading to overlapping
rconfiguration load sequences and crashes from inconsistent config states
Squid will now ignore reconfigure requests before startup has read the
initial config file and treat repeated signals during reconfigure as a
single request to reload squid.conf when the current operation has
completed.



* Bug #4188: Bumping intercepted SSL connections does not work on
  Solaris

This bug turned out to be missing logics in the I/O module handling
/dev/poll on Solaris. It affects all TLS/SSL connections being received
or generated by Squid. All users of Squid on Solaris wanting to use
TLS/SSL enabled Squid need to upgrade to at least this release.



* Connection stats, including %&lt;lp, missing for persistent connections.

When re-using a persistent connection the statistics and logging state
was not being correctly updated. At least the %&lt;lp and %&lt;la log values
were incorrect for these transactions. As are the SNMP counters for
transactions per upstream server/IP. There may be other state details
affected which we are not aware of, so do not be too alarmed if there
are some traffic anomalies appearing after upgrade.



* Memory Issues

A nasty memory management bug has been found in the &quot;SBuf&quot; buffer
logics. This buffer type is not used very widely in Squid-3.x but as it
is used for generic I/O buffering may still have been responsible for
random unidentifiable crashes.



 All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade to this release as time
permits.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html</A>
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.5

Upgrade tip:
  &quot;squid -k parse&quot; is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.
