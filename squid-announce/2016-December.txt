Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 4.0.17 beta is available
Message-ID: <836ad21b-4249-dc71-a6ef-bc775f06551d@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.17 release!


This release is a security and bug fix release resolving several issues
found in the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:

* SQUID-2016:10 Information disclosure in Collapsed Forwarding
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_10.txt>

This problem allows a remote attacker to discover private and sensitive
information about another clients browsing session. Potentially
including credentials which allow access to further sensitive resources.

This problem only affects Squid configured to use the Collapsed
Forwarding feature. It is of particular importance for HTTPS
reverse-proxy sites with Collapsed Forwarding.

This problem is present on all 3.5 releases, though 3.5.22 is hit worst
due to the collapsed revalidation extension increasing the scope of
traffic which can be collapsed.


* SQUID-2016:11 Information disclosure in HTTP Request processing
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_11.txt>

This problem allows a remote attacker to discover private and sensitive
information about another clients browsing session. Potentially
including credentials which allow access to further sensitive resources.

This vulnerability is present in all Squid-3.1 and later versions. The
only known workaround is to prevent caching entirely, which is far from
ideal.


* TLS: Support tunneling of bumped non-HTTP traffic

Previously, the use of "on_unsupported_protocol tunnel" resulted in
encrypted HTTP 400 (Bad Request) messages sent to clients that do not
speak HTTP(S). Such as Skype groups, which appear to use TLS-encrypted
MSNP protocol instead of HTTPS.

This Squid allows admins using SslBump to tunnel Skype groups and
similar non-HTTP traffic bytes via "on_unsupported_protocol tunnel all".



 All users of Squid-4.x are urged to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.

 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to test this release out and plan
for upgrades where possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-4

    Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2016:10
__________________________________________________________________

Advisory ID:        SQUID-2016:10
Date:               Dec 16, 2016
Summary:            Information disclosure
                    in Collapsed Forwarding.
Affected versions:  Squid 3.5 -> 3.5.22
                    Squid 4.0 -> 4.0.16
Fixed in version:   Squid 4.0.17, 3.5.23
__________________________________________________________________

    http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_10.txt
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Due to incorrect comparsion of request headers Squid can deliver
 responses containing private data to clients it should not have
 reached.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 This problem allows a remote attacker to discover private and
 sensitive information about another clients browsing session.
 Potentially including credentials which allow access to further
 sensitive resources.

 This problem only affects Squid configured to use the Collapsed
 Forwarding feature.

 It is of particular importance for HTTPS reverse-proxy sites
 with Collapsed Forwarding.

__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

 This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.5.23 and 4.0.17.

 In addition, patches addressing this problem can be found in our
 patch archives:

Squid 3.5 (excluding 3.5.22):
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2016_10_a.patch>

Squid 3.5.22:
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-14127.patch>

Squid 4.0:
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-14956.patch>

 If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
 to the package vendor for availability information on updated
 packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

 Squid-2.x have not been tested.


 The following command can be used to determine if Squid-3 or
 later have collapsed_forwarding in squid.conf:

  (squid -k parse 2>&1) | grep collapsed_forwarding


 All Squid-3.x versions without collapsed_forwarding configured
 are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.5 versions with 'collapsed_forwarding off'
 configured are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.5 versions up to and including Squid-3.5.22 with
 'collapsed_forwarding on' configured are vulnerable.

 All Squid-4.0 versions without collapsed_forwarding configured
 are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-4.0 versions with 'collapsed_forwarding off'
 configured are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-4.0 versions up to and including Squid-4.0.16 with
 'collapsed_forwarding on' configured are vulnerable.

__________________________________________________________________

Workaround:

 Remove all uses of 'collapsed_forwarding' from squid.conf and
 included sub-files.

Message-ID: <6d7c243b-a7dc-0f21-f1c8-7a23300c9b75@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.23 release!


This release is a security and bug fix release resolving several issues
found in the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:

* SQUID-2016:10 Information disclosure in Collapsed Forwarding
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_10.txt>

This problem allows a remote attacker to discover private and sensitive
information about another clients browsing session. Potentially
including credentials which allow access to further sensitive resources.

This problem only affects Squid configured to use the Collapsed
Forwarding feature. It is of particular importance for HTTPS
reverse-proxy sites with Collapsed Forwarding.

This problem is present on all 3.5 releases, though 3.5.22 is hit worst
due to the collapsed revalidation extension increasing the scope of
traffic which can be collapsed.


* SQUID-2016:11 Information disclosure in HTTP Request processing
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_11.txt>

This problem allows a remote attacker to discover private and sensitive
information about another clients browsing session. Potentially
including credentials which allow access to further sensitive resources.

This vulnerability is present in all Squid-3.1 and later versions. The
only known workaround is to prevent caching entirely, which is far from
ideal.


* Bug #4169: HIT marked as MISS when If-None-Match does not match
* Bug #3940: Host verify failures MISS when they should be HIT
* Bug #3533: Cache still valid after HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
* Bug #2258: bypassing cache but not destroying cache entry

These bugs all share a common thread of reducing cache efficiency. This
Squid will now leave existing cache content in place for use unless the
new client response is able to be shared with other clients. Some of
these bugs are only partially fixed so further improvements may be possible.


* HTTP/1.1: make Vary:* objects cacheable

Under RFC 2616 responses containing "Vary: *" header were not cachable.
That requirement has been loosened by RFC 7231 and Squid is now able to
cache these responses.


* ssl::server_name ACL badly broken since inception

The original server_name code mishandled all SNI checks and some rare
host checks. This was most visible with the reports that the
ssl::server_name ACL tests would fail where the equivalent regex ACL
test would behave differently, usually by matching. Or in situations
where neither would match despite the value appearing to be available.


* TLS: Make key= before cert= an error instead of quietly hiding the issue

Previous versions of Squid would accept the TLS/SSL key= parameter being
configured first before cert= parameter. But would then silently discard
the key settings when loading the cert file. This would lead to
unexpected behaviour or obscure 'permission' errors.

This release will now produce a FATAL error and halt if configured with
a key= parameter before its matched cert= parameter.



 All users of Squid-3 are urged to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.
