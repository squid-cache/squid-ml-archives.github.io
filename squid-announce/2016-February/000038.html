<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.6 release!


This release is a security release resolving one major vulnerability and
several other bugs found in the prior Squid releases.

  NP: this release announcement also covers 4.0.5 change details.


The major changes to be aware of:


* SQUID-2016:1 - Remote Denial of Service in SSL/TLS handling

    <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_1.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2016_1.txt</A>

This shows up as Squid crashing after a failed TLS server connection.
Since Squid built with TLS/SSL support perform outbound TLS server
connections independent of inbound client request type it can be
triggered by a plain-text HTTP message.

 Affected Squid versions are:
   3.5.13, 4.0.4, 4.0.5 built using --with-openssl

See the advisory for further details. Upgrade to this beta is highly
recommended, even for older unaffected Squid-4 releases.


* Several regression bugs fixed

 - Bug 4436: Fix DEFAULT_SSL_CRTD
 - Bug 4429: http(s)_port options= error message missing characters
 - Bug 4410: compile error in basic_ncsa_auth after 4.0.4
 - Bug 4403: helper compile errors after 4.0.4
 - Bug 4401: compile error on Solaris
 - Fix: TLS/SSL flags parsing
 - Fix: cert validator always disabled in 4.0.x
 - Fix: Name-only note ACL stopped matching after 4.0.4 (note -m)
 - Fix: external_acl problems after 4.0.1


* SSL related helpers changed

This release adds two new ./configure options
  --enable-security-validators=
  --enable-security-generators=

These build options operate the same as external ACL and authentication
helper build options. But control whether the SSL certificate validator
and SSL-Bump certificate generator helper(s) are built.

As part of this change;

 - the ssl_crtd helper is renamed to security_file_certgen
   (built with --enable-security-generators=file), and

 - the cert_valid.pl helper is renamed to security_fake_certverify
   (built with --enable-security-validators=fake).


* Add connections_encrypted ACL

This new ACL only matches true when all the external connections
involved with a transaction (so far) have been secured. It can be used
to prohibit sending traffic received over a secure connection to
insecure services such as URL-rewriters, ICAP, eCAP, cache_peer, or to
set tcp_outgoing_* details differently for secure/insecure transactions.


* Fix SSL-Bump step 3 splice action

This bug shows up as Squid HTTPS transactions hanging while contacting
an upstream TLS server. It occurs when splice action is selected for use
at stage 3 of SSL-Bumping.



 All users of Squid-4.0.x are urged to upgrade to this release as soon
as possible.

 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to test this release out and plan
for upgrades where possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
