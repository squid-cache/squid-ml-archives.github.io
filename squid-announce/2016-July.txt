Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 3.5.20 is available
Message-ID: <8f3a42d3-eda8-f57f-b7d3-fa3e98904dbf@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.20 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in the
prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Fix icons loading speed.

This bug had the annoying result of making Squid startup or restart very
slow. All installations should see a few seconds shaved off startup and
restart.


* Do not allow low-level debugging to hide important/critical messages.

Due to the way debugging log records were produced in previous Squid it
was possible for some important or critical messages containing
complicated mesage to become hidden.

Please note that if this version suddenly starts reporting high level
errors previously unseen it may not be a regression, but simply that you
were not seeing them before.


* Support unified EUI format code in external_acl_type.

Squid supports %>eui as a logformat specifier, which produces an EUI-48
for IPv4 clients and an EUI-64 for IPv6 clients. This adds that format
specifier for use in the external ACLs format.


* Fixed ConnStateData::In::maybeMakeSpaceAvailable() logic.

This hopefully resolves some nasty performance behaviours with large
objects where Squid would eventually degrade down to a slow speed
sending many small packets.



 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to upgrade to this release as
time permits.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
