<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.14 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in the
prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Bugs #4404 and #4503: access.log responses marked _ABORTED

The past few Squid-4 releases have incorrectly logged several
transaction types as ABORTED. This hopefully resolves the
remaininginstances of that behaviour.


* Make Squid death due to overloaded helpers optional

Previous Squid versions would halt the entire Squid process if a helper
became too non-responsive and its lookup queue became overloaded. This
release allows the Squid handling behaviour to be configured to simulate
an ERR helper response instead of always halting.


* Crashes on shutdown

The Squid shutdown process when set to a short timeout was crashing
while cleaning up idle ICAP connections. This resolves the ICAP issues,
however some other sources of shutdown crash still remain to be fixed.



* Various HTTP/1.1 compliance updates

Previous Squid releases have a number of compliance issues with RFC 7230
updated HTTP specifications. This release fixes several issues involved
with detecting invalid message framing and required error reponse
generation.


* General portability and stability changes

This release also includes a large number of code cleanup fixes too
small to mention individually, but which resolve a lot of portability
and build issues.

The release size appears to be very large, however the majority of
alterations are in documentation and translation updates for Squid-4.



 All users of Squid-4.0.x are encouraged to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.

 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to test this release out and plan
for upgrades where possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
