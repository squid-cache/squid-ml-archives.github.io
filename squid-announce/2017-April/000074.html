<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.19 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in the
prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:

* Bug #4671: various GCC 7 compile errors

GCC 7 adds a number of new warnings and behaviour checking that prevents
building older releases easily. This release fixes most of the issues
and should build most features. However, some more have been found since
release bundling.


* Fix two read-ahead problems related to delay pools (or lack of thereof).

Squid delays reading from the server after buffering read_ahead_gap
bytes that are not yet sent to the client. A delayed read is normally
resumed after Squid sends more buffered bytes to the client. However,
Squid was not resuming the delayed read after all Store clients were gone.


* Crypto-NG: initial GnuTLS support for encrypted server connections

This release adds support for servicing <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs received from
clients, and TLS connections to cache_peer when built with GnuTLS.

Advanced GnuTLS TLS options= strings in squid.conf are significantly
different from OpenSSL options. See the release notes and squid.conf
documentation for specific details.

NOTE: https_port and SSL-Bump features are not yet supported with GnuTLS.


 All users of Squid-4.x are urged to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.

 All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to test this release out and plan
for upgrades where possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
