<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.1 release!


This release is we believe, stable enough for general production use.

Support for Squid-3.x bug fixes has now officially ceased. Bugs in 3.5
will continue to be fixed, however the fixes will be added to the 4.x
series. All users of Squid-3.x are encouraged to plan for upgrades.


A short list of the major new features is:

 * RFC 6176 compliance (SSLv2 support removal)
 * Secure ICAP service connections
 * Add url_lfs_rewrite: a URL-rewriter based on local file existence
 * on_unsupported_protocol directive to allow Non-HTTP bypass
 * Update external_acl_type directive to use logformat codes
 * Experimental GnuTLS support for some TLS features
 * TLS/SSL related helpers renamed


Several features have been removed in 4.1:

 * refresh_pattern ignore-auth and ignore-must-revalidate options
 * cache_peer_domain directive
 * basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth helper
 * ESI custom parser - use XML2 or Expat instead.

Further details can be found in the release notes or the wiki.

<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-4">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-4</A>


Please remember to run &quot;squid -k parse&quot; when testing upgrade to a new
version of Squid. It will audit your configuration files and report
any identifiable issues the new release will have in your installation
before you &quot;press go&quot;.

Please be particularly aware that for the TLS features the removal of
SSLv2 support may require manual attention to configuration settings
when upgrading from any Squid-3 or older version.


All feature additions are considered *experimental* until they have
survived at least one series of releases in general production use.
Please be aware of that when rolling out features which are new in
this series. Not all use-cases have been well tested yet and some may
not even have been implemented. Assistance is still needed despite the
releases general stability level.


Plans for the next series of releases is already well underway. Our
future release plans and upcoming features can be found at:

 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

  All users of Squid-4.0 beta releases are urged to upgrade to this
  release as soon as possible.

  All users of Squid-3 are encouraged to upgrades where possible.
