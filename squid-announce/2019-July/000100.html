<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.8 release!


This release is a security release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


 * SQUID-2019:1 Denial of Service issue in cachemgr.cgi
   (CVE-2019-12854)

This issue security vulnerability is in the cachemgr.cgi tool (not the
squid proxy). With certain requests the cachemgr.cgi may access
unallocated memory.

On systems with memory access protections this can result in the CGI
process terminating unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial of service for
all clients using it.

See the advisory for more details:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_1.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_1.txt</A>&gt;


 * SQUID-2019:2 Denial of Service in HTTP Basic Authentication
   (CVE-2019-12529)

The Basic authentication credentials decoder may access memory outside
the decode buffer.

On systems with memory access protections this can result in the Squid
process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial of service
for all clients using the proxy.

See the advisory for more details:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_2.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_2.txt</A>&gt;


 * SQUID-2019:3 Denial of Service in HTTP Digest Authentication
   (CVE-2019-12525)

The HTTP Request header parser for Digest authentication may access
memory outside the allocated memory buffer.

On systems with memory access protections this can result in the Squid
process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial of service
for all clients using the proxy.

See the advisory for more details:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_3.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_3.txt</A>&gt;


 * SQUID-2019:5 Heap Overflow issue in HTTP Basic Authentication
   (CVE-2019-12527)

This allows a malicious client to write a substantial amount of
arbitrary data to the heap. Potentially gaining ability to execute
arbitrary code.

On systems with memory access protections this can result in the Squid
process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in a denial of service
for all clients using the proxy.

This issue is limited to traffic accessing the Squid Cache Manager
reports or using the FTP protocol gateway.

See the advisory for more details:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_5.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_5.txt</A>&gt;


 * SQUID-2019:6 Multiple Cross-Site Scripting issues in cachemgr.cgi
   (CVE-2019-13345)

This allows a malicious server to embed URLs in its content such that
user credentials and other information can be extracted from a client or
administrator with access to the Squid cachemgr.cgi tool URL.

See the advisory for more details:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_6.txt">http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_6.txt</A>&gt;


 * Regression: Fix tls-min-version= being ignored

Squid-4 has been allowing negotiation of TLS versions prohibited by this
option. Also, for some configurations the tls-options= also does not
work as intended. This release fixes both these options to work as
documented.


 * Add the NO_TLSv1_3 option to available tls-options values

This release brings the ability to prohibit OpenSSL from negotiating
TLS/1.3 with clients, peers or servers.


 * Bug 4953: to_localhost does not include ::

Some OS treat unspecified destination address as an implicit
localhost connection attempt. This was a well-known issue with IPv4
which was supposed to be prohibited with IPv6 traffic. However, once
again OS have appeared which treat IPv6 :: as an alias of localhost.

To make matters worse some domains return :: explicitly as their IP
address to DNS AAAA queries.

We have added ::/128 to the pre-defined to_localhost ACL. Any users of
that ACL not able to update are advised to add this to their squid.conf
immediately:

  acl to_localhost dst ::/128


 * Bug 4889: Ignore ECONNABORTED in accept(2)

This shows up as a large number of hung socket connections and/or
cache.log entries like:
  oldAccept ...: (53) Software caused connection abort

It primarily occurs on OpenBSD 6.5 and later, but may be seen on other
systems as well.



  All users of Squid are urged to upgrade as soon as possible.


See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
releases.
