    <A HREF="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11945">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11945</A>
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Due to an integer overflow bug Squid is vulnerable to credential
 replay and remote code execution attacks against HTTP Digest
 Authentication tokens.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 When memory pooling is used this problem allows a remote client
 to replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access
 to resources that are otherwise forbidden.

 When memory pooling is disabled this problem allows a remote
 client to perform remote code execution through the free'd nonce
 credentials.

__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

 This bug is fixed by Squid versions 4.11 and 5.0.2.

 In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
 releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 4:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-eeebf0f37a72a2de08348e85ae34b02c34e9a811.patch">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-eeebf0f37a72a2de08348e85ae34b02c34e9a811.patch</A>&gt;
