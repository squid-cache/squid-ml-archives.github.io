Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 4.16 is available
Message-ID: <860aceb6-9cb4-049f-e683-9d288a876f79@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.16 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving several issues found in
the prior Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of since 4.15:

  * Regression Fix: --with-valgrind-debug build

Squid-4.15 changes caused a build failure linking with valgrind
memory tracking tool. This release fixes that to allow memory
leak tracing again.


  * Bug 4528: ICAP transactions quit on async DNS lookups

Squid has never reliably been able to resolve hostnames configured
for ICAP services. They might work most of the time when added to
/etc/hosts, but not always - and would rarely work if relying on
remote DNS servers.

This release adds full support for DNS remote resolution of
service names in icap_service directive. Regardless of where the
hostname is resolved from it can now be expected to resolve and
also properly obey DNS TTL expiry for IP address changes.


  * Bug 5128: Translation: Fix '% i' typo in es/ERR_FORWARDING_DENIED

Spanish translation of the ERR_FORWARDING_DENIED template have
for some time omitted the URL which was having issues being fetched.
The template published with this release and current squid-langpack
downloads will now display the URL identically to other error pages.


   All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.


See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
releases.
