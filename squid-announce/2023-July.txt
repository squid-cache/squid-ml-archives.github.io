Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 6.1 is available
Message-ID: <947c49c0-a6af-539b-2590-6415f60e339e@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-6.1 release!


This release is we believe, stable enough for general production use.


Support for Squid-5 bug fixes has now officially ceased. Bugs in 5.x
will continue to be fixed, however the fixes will be added to the 6.x
series. All users of Squid-5.x are encouraged to plan for upgrades.


A short list of the major new features is:

  * TLS ServerHello
  * Log TLS Communication Secrets
  * RFC 9211: HTTP Cache-Status support
  * ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl: Support -b with -D


Some features have been removed in 6.1:

  * Remove Gopher Protocol Support
  * Removed Outdated Tools
  * Ban ACL key changes in ACLs
  * Block to-local Traffic
  * RFC 9111: Stop treating Warning specially


Further details can be found in the release notes or the wiki.

  https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Releases/Squid-6


Please remember to run "squid -k parse" when testing upgrade to a new
version of Squid. It will audit your configuration files and report
any identifiable issues the new release will have in your installation
before you "press go".


All feature additions are considered *experimental* until they have
survived at least one series of releases in general production use.
Please be aware of that when rolling out features which are new in
this series. Not all use-cases have been well tested yet and some may
not even have been implemented. Assistance is still needed despite the
releases general stability level.


Plans for the next series of releases is already well underway. Our
future release plan and upcoming features can be found at:

  See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
  releases.

   All users of Squid-6.0 beta releases are urged to
   upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

   All users of Squid-5 are encouraged to
   upgrade where possible.

Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 4 end of support
Message-ID: <ca8d2e09-5f35-5936-ebc3-fa616baaff90@treenet.co.nz>

Hi all,

With Squid v6.1 release the Squid Project will no longer
officially support Squid v4.

What does this mean?

Effective immediately;

  * no more official Squid v4 snapshots will be published.

  * security vulnerabilities only affecting Squid v4 (or older
    releases) will not get a formal Squid advisory issued.

In the following days/weeks;

  * Squid Official CI testing specific to Squid v4 will be
    disabled and removed.

  * Bug reports submitted against Squid v4 (or older releases)
    may be asked to confirm that the problem is still present
    in Squid v5 (or later releases).
