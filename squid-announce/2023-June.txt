Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 6.0.3 beta is available
Message-ID: <bd6155ba-d4b8-28fb-dbb1-a9f50465b5f2@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid-6.0.3 beta release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving some issues
found in the prior Squid releases.

The major changes to be aware of:

  * Bug 5148: Log %Ss of failed tunnels as TCP_TUNNEL

When Squid failed to open a TCP connection while handling a
CONNECT request, Squid logged %Ss as NONE_NONE or TAG_NONE.
This Squid should now log TCP_TUNNEL for all CONNECT attempts.


  * Do not leak Security::CertErrors created in X509_verify_cert()

This bug shows up as a small and erratic memory leak when TLS
traffic is handled in production, which can disappear when
testing.


   All users of Squid-6 are encouraged to
   upgrade as soon as possible.

   All users of Squid-5 are encouraged to
   test this release and plan for upgrade as time permits.


See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and
earlier releases.
