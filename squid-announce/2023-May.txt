Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 5.9 is available
Message-ID: <2AF06608-8F25-4424-B974-91D73397D94E@squid-cache.org>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid-5.9 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving some issues
found in the prior Squid releases.

The major changes to be aware of:

* Improve reply_body_max_size matching accuracy

This bug shows up as cache.log entries at debug level >=3
stating "HttpReply.cc(..) receivedBodyTooLarge: (negative number) >? -1"

In such cases, reply_body_max_size configuration would be
ignored, resulting in undercounting of traffic.

* Fix build issues highlighted by the most recent versions of
  GCC and Clang.

* Portability fixes for ESI, bundled GnuRegex, and GnuTLS


All users of Squid-5 are encouraged to upgrade as time permits.

See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and
earlier releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-5

This new release can be downloaded from our HTTP or FTP servers
