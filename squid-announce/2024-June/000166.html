Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2024:3

________________________________
Advisory ID: SQUID-2024:3
Date: Jun 10, 2024
Summary: Denial of Service in ESI processing
Affected versions: Squid 3.0 -&gt; 3.5.28
                  Squid 4.0 -&gt; 4.16
                  Squid 5.0 -&gt; 5.9
                  Squid 6.0 -&gt; 6.9
Fixed in version:Squid 6.10
________________________________

Problem Description:

Due to an Out-of-bounds Write error when assigning ESI variables,
Squid is susceptible to a Memory Corruption error, which can
result in a Denial of Service.

________________________________

Severity:

This problem allows a trusted server to perform a Denial of Service attack on
Squid while processing ESI response content.
This affects all domains being serviced by the proxy and all clients using
it during the affected period.

The trigger for this issue are values which clients might normally expect to use
in valid ESI response content. As such admin should expect this issue to be
already occurring without any malicious 0-day attack existing.

This issue is limited to Squid acting as reverse proxy where ESI
feature has been
enabled at build time

CVSS Score of 6.3
&lt;<A HREF="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H&amp;version=3.1">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H&amp;version=3.1</A>&gt;

________________________________

Updated Packages:

This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.10.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 3.x, 4, or 5:
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/f411fe7d75197852f0e5ee85027a06d58dd8df4c.patch">https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/f411fe7d75197852f0e5ee85027a06d58dd8df4c.patch</A>&gt;

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.

________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.

All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not
vulnerable.

All Squid-3.x versions built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.9 built with --enable-esi
are vulnerable

________________________________

Workaround:

* Build Squid with --disable-esi
