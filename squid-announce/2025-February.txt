Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 6.13 is available
Message-ID: <CA+Y8hcP1O=W6OCiFn+JPcjjmnchW5kjniDwJ9AxK01B2rKGxkg@mail.gmail.com>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-6.13 release

This release is, we believe, stable enough for general production use.
We encourage all users of Squid-6 to upgrade to this version.
It contains:
- several bug fixes
- portability and build improvements
- documentation improvements

Further details, release notes, and source archives can be found at
https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_6_13
(look for the "Bootstrapped sources" links there).
As a reminder, we no longer directly distribute our releases
over FTP, rsync, or through mirrors.

Please remember to run "squid -k parse" when upgrading to a new
version of Squid. It will audit your configuration files and report
any identifiable issues the new release will have in your installation
before you "press go".

This is the last version of the Squid 6 series we release before
version 7 is branched tomorrow, the 2nd of February 2025,
as per our Release Schedule
(see https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule).

It is only fitting that these releases are happening during FOSDEM,
the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting.

Subject: [squid-announce] Squid 7.0.1 BETA is available
Message-ID: <CA+Y8hcNPm-P6pQnfLYtOv=xomb4_U7eTaPyKdiz_YdchCiHcZA@mail.gmail.com>

The Squid Web Cache team is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid 7.0.1 beta release!

This new 7.x series of Squid brings useful new features, changes
and bug fixes over earlier release series

More detailed descriptions of the major new features downloadable
files and release signatures are are available at:
   <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_7_0_1>

Detailed lists of the ./configure build and squid.conf changes can also
be found in the release notes.

This code is released as beta for wider testing purposes and potential
use. There are no more planned alterations to the existing features,
./configure options or squid.conf options for release 7.

We routinely test Squid for compatibility with major Operating Systems
and hardware platforms, including most current Linux distributions,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and MacOS/Homebrew

Major features dropped:

 * Edge Side Include (ESI): no longer used widely enough to justify
   the ongoing effort of maintaining it
 * ident protocol: an insecure relic of earlier Internet days
 * cache_object protocol support: replaced by HTTP and the well-known
   URL prefix /squid-internal-mgr/
 * 'cachemgr.cgi', 'purge' and 'squidclient' tools: their functions can
   now be implemented using standard HTTP clients such as curl


Changes in distribution channels:

Squid is no longer distributed via ftp or rsync.
The only channel for releases is now github, at the URL:
   <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_7_0_1>


We encourage early adopters and testers to try this version out
and provide feedback about bugs and issues at
   <https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>

Thanks!
