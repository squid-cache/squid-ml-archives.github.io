The Squid Web Cache team is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid 7.0.1 beta release!

This new 7.x series of Squid brings useful new features, changes
and bug fixes over earlier release series

More detailed descriptions of the major new features, downloadable
files, and release signatures are are available at:
<https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_7_0_2>

Detailed lists of the ./configure build and squid.conf changes can also
be found in the release notes.

This code is released as beta for wider testing purposes and potential
use. There are no more planned alterations to the existing features,
./configure options or squid.conf options for release 7.

We routinely test Squid for compatibility with major Operating Systems
and hardware platforms, including most current Linux distributions,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and MacOS/Homebrew

Since version 7.0.1, a few bugs have been squashed, and portability
has been improved
