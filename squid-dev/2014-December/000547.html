Yes, but I am worried that nextToken can point to the very beginning of
the current buffer, rendering *(nextToken-1) invalid.

</I>
Why do you expect that strcspn() to always return a positive value?


&gt;<i> If the buffer starts with a '\' character the nextToken should be
</I>&gt;<i> pointing at its escaped value character. 
</I>
Where would nextToken be increased in that case, prior to reaching the
loop? AFAICT, strcspn() would return zero when the buffer starts with a
backslash and, hence, nextToken will remain pointing at the beginning of
the buffer. It is possible that I have overlooked some other code that
makes that impossible, but even if I did, the change looks very fragile
at best.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by a backslash (because that backslash is itself escaped).
</I>
&gt;<i> This code does not un-escape anything. All it does is notice '\'
</I>&gt;<i> escapes and ensures that both the '\' and character following are
</I>&gt;<i> included in the token
</I>
Unfortunately, the same code also includes characters that were _not_
protected/escaped/whatever by '\'. Details below.


&gt;<i> The regex pattern parser is responsible for any
</I>&gt;<i> un-escaping and processing of the token itself.
</I>
Agreed. I am only talking about tokenizing, which is this code
responsibility.


&gt;<i>     while (... *(nextToken-1) == '\\') {
</I>&gt;<i>         ++nextToken; // skip the quoted-pair (\-escaped) character
</I>

I am talking about the &quot;skip&quot; code above. It is incorrectly skipping X
in &quot;\\X&quot;. For example, it will &quot;skip&quot; (i.e., include in token) a space
character in

  foo\\ bar

The above text has two space-separated tokens: &quot;foo\\&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, but
the loop will treat that text as one token, because it sees the space
character as &quot;escaped&quot;. That is wrong AFAICT.


&gt;&gt;<i> Except for the nextToken-1 concerns, the above corrections are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cosmetic, of course.
</I>

&gt;<i> Fixed all, and applied to trunk as rev.13730
</I>

The two non-cosmetic concerns remain for the now-committed code IMO.


Thank you,

Alex.
