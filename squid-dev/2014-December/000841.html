What &quot;session ID&quot;? There is no such thing as sessions in HTTP.

</I>
Connection ID is not an option, with middleware there are already 2
HTTP connections, maybe more involved with any given message.

The rest of these answers are being debated in IETF by people which
want to make HTTP stateful and revert Internet into a telephone style
trunk-switching network model. The proponents seem to be either the
teleco people who it seems cant/wont pick up the ideas of
packet-switching model, or the surveillance people who want to link
sessions to peoples national ID numbers and track their movements.

&gt;<i> What is the maximum concurrent connections we expect a proxy to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to handle?
</I>
millions. The load balancer guys in IETF are already complaining that
a 32-bit int is barely enought to count things for long periods of
time (rolls over within hours already).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the above decisions would probably also need to take in 
</I>&gt;<i> account HTTP/2.0.
</I>
HTTP/2.0 is orthogonal to traditional the session idea. Both a single
message and a connection are &quot;sessions&quot; with many sub-pieces. Neither
one of them cleanly applies to the stateful sequence of application
messages people describe as a &quot;browsing session&quot; and send around in
Cookie headers these days.
