in src/redirect.cc:
* the change to redirector bypass is undocumented. The bypass was
previously a bypass of queueing as well as helper. If we now wait
until the queue is full then we have not bypassed the queueing.
 - I think for backward compatibility redirector_bypass should
implicitly set default queue-size to be 0.


in cf.data.pre:
* &quot;overloading persist squid may abort its operation&quot; for
url_rewrite_children and store_id_children
  - s/persist/persists/

* &quot;then storeID helper bypassed&quot;
  s/bypassed/is bypassed/

* need to document how the redirector/storeid helper bypass has changed.
 - when bypass AND queue-size&gt;0 are configured a queue exists, older
config the queue was always bypassed.


in src/external_acl.cc:
* there is no need for the temporary local int queue_size
  - use atoi() to set children.queue_size member and adjust later with
if condition like the others.

* in the if-condition calling trySubmit() the debugs outputs a
hard-coded &quot;queue is too long&quot; error. This is an assumption which will
not always be true - there are many reasons a submit may fail to
submit (helper dying early, shutting down, etc).
 - the right place to output that error is inside trySubmit() where I
see it already does so.
 - if a debugs is needed on trySubmit() failure it should only say
that submit failed. Cannot say why exactly.


in src/src/helper/ChildConfig.cc:
* the second constructor is passed n_max value to use. Should be
setting default queue-size to 2*m at that point instead of 0 for
helpers which are not configured explicitly with children parameters.


in src/helper.cc: (optional but desirable to reduce code)
* why are you retaining the legacy helperSubmit() now that helpers all
have a members?
 - the helpers still using old queue limits should just have
queue_size hard-coded to those limits and use the new API methods.

* helperStatefulSubmit() is/was only used by Negotiate and NTLM auth
helpers which you have documented as supporting the new queue-size. So
there should be no need for helperStatefulSubmit() to exist now.
 - you can probably remove both these wrappers by making submit()
virtual, and both submit() and trySubmit() receive a 'lastserver'
parameter (default of NULL for it).


Also:
 * missing doc/release-notes/release-3.6.sgml entries for the updated
config directives.

* please take care updatign to current trunk, CBDATA details have been
altered around some of these chunks.
