Overall, I agree with Christos here. While the underlying functionality
is similar, the usability of human-friendly keywords is better for
admins, especially for those admins that are not intimately familiar
with our [rather ugly] helper protocol and/or do not want to track
future protocol changes.

The &quot;use configured response&quot; functionality is a fine-tuning knob for
those few admins that need precise control. The simple actions are for
90% of the admins who do not really need that.


I agree with Amos that the response=... option does not have to have an
explicit on-timeout action (because the option determines the action).
If we make this change, the admin will have to pick one of the two
url_rewrite_timeout formats, along these lines:

  url_rewrite_timeout timeout time-units on_timeout=&lt;fail|bypass|retry&gt;
  url_rewrite_timeout timeout time-units timeout_response=...

Personally, I think the originally proposed syntax (with the required
on_timeout action) is easier to understand because it is more
explicit/straightforward, but it is not a big deal IMO. Amos, if the
on_timeout action stays, would you still prefer the dual format sketched
above?


&gt;&gt;<i> By all means call (and clear) the callback on a timeout but please do

&gt;<i> Some of the queries will never  answered. This is may result to memory leaks. 
</I>
Exactly! We must remove timed out transactions from Squid memory. There
is no good reason to keep them around because nobody is waiting for them
anymore.


Thank you,

Alex.
