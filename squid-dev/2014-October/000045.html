</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> And Christos patch description: &quot; the desired maximum lifetime of a
</I>&gt;<i> persistent connection. &quot;
</I>
Yes. No &quot;side&quot; limitation here.


&gt;<i> Having read through the patch. What it does is *only* set a timer

</I>&gt;<i> timeouts applied later on that connection to be no more than the 
</I>&gt;<i> configured total.
</I>
The patch should limit the _total_ pconn lifetime (but enforce that
limit only when Squid thinks the persistent connection is [going to
be] idle). Also, it should apply the same logic to origin server
connections that we pool. AFAICT, the patch does all of the above. If
it does not, there is a bug in the patch. More on that further below.

Please note that I use the term &quot;idle from Squid point of view&quot; as in
&quot;may be closed without causing much harm&quot;. That is, it is an opposite
of &quot;in the middle of handling some transaction&quot;. We could split hairs
arguing about some corner cases, but I hope we do not have to do that.


&gt;&gt;<i> Moreover, pconn_lifetime is meant to apply to all connections,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not just the connections from a client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then Christos patch is seriously incomplete, because it only
</I>&gt;<i> affects connections arriving from clients. The lifetime is never
</I>&gt;<i> set on any of the other types of connection that make up &quot;all&quot;.
</I>
AFAICT, the patch affects both HTTP user and origin connections. The
origin connections are affected by pconn.cc changes. Perhaps I
misinterpreted that change or you missed it?

I am not 100% sure, but I suspect those pconn.cc changes affect ICAP
connection as well.

As we discussed, the patch does not add new code to pool idle HTTP
user connections -- that big change is outside this patch scope, but
when/if that code is added, the same approach can be applied there
trivially.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * update tunnel.cc client connection timeouts to use 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conn-&gt;timeLeft(). - maybe with some new tunnel-specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lifetime config item. But I think your new config lifetime is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate for now at least.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is no concept of &quot;idle persistent connection&quot; for TCP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tunnels so we should not apply pconn_lifetime to them right now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You added &quot;idle&quot; to that description. The code in question *does
</I>&gt;<i> not* limit itself to idle connections, nor persistent connections.
</I>
I did not add that. The proposed feature should apply to &quot;idle&quot;
connections only, as documented: &quot;When set, Squid will close a
now-idle persistent connection that ...&quot;


&gt;<i> So do we at least have a consensus on terminology:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That &quot;lifetime&quot; for a connection means from its opening 
</I>&gt;<i> accept()/connect() to its close()  ??
</I>
Yes, as documented in the patch: 'Connection lifetime is the time
period from the connection acceptance or opening time until &quot;now&quot;'.


&gt;<i> That the bits named FOO_timeout means some duration of that
</I>&gt;<i> lifetime spent doing a &quot;FOO&quot; ??
</I>
Timeout and lifetime are very different things so I would not mix them
up like that, but yes, agents may do FOO during their lifetime (often
many times!).


Hope this clarifies,

Alex.
