Kinkie brought up the idea of a Squid 4.x release in IRC.

I have mentioned to a few clients who asked when 4.0 would be out that
we will probably want it to be a big reason, like changing the
language was between the 2.x to 3.x versions.

I have usually had in mind a change along the lines of:
 - libraries building with Erlang/Ada/Go, or
 - redesigning the whole packaging structure (but we already have
SourceLayout without it), or
 - redesigning the event processing system (but we already did
AsyncJob without it).

Then again, we actually *are* planning a language change in the next
few months.

The C++03 to C++11 transition will bring with it a relatively large
bump in the minimum toolchain and thus OS support. So while it's not a
radical change it is probably worth considering as a good reason for
calling the next series 4.0.

If we do so we would also need to treat 3.5 as somewhat of an LTE
release. That was on the cards anyway for older OS with backports
having the same criteria of building on C++03 compilers. The version
bump would make it somewhat formal though with us needing to take on
the maintenance instead of punting it off to commercial or distro
support teams. Are we prepared as a group to go for that?

We have most of the coming year to think about this. I just thought I
would poke the idea out there early to get maximum length of
consideration.
