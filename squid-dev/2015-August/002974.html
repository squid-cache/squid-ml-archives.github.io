... and mind this mess and admin confusion is a direct (and predicted)
result of conflating one single access control with all of the TLS
related authentication + authorization + processing control logics.

Thanks for doing this patch anyway. Adjusting allow_t like this has been
on the TODO list for auth related issues a long time before ssl-bump
existed.


&gt;<i> While configuration workarounds are possible, the current implementation
</I>&gt;<i> is very wrong and leads to overly complex and, hence, often wrong
</I>&gt;<i> configurations. It is also nearly impossible to document accurately
</I>&gt;<i> because the guessing logic depends on too many factors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To fix this, we add an action filtering/banning mechanism to Squid ACL
</I>&gt;<i> code. This mechanism is then used to:
</I>&gt;<i>   - ban client-first and server-first on bumping steps 2 and 3.
</I>
How about we just remove of client-first entirely?
 It has major security issues for which CVE already exist. The one
remaining use-case AFAICT is malware using Squid.

The attempted seamless upgrade from old configs was an outright failure.
So I think we can shorten the deprecation time without additional pain.


&gt;<i>   - ban peek and stare actions on bumping step 3.
</I>&gt;<i>   - ban splice on step3 if stare is selected on step2 and
</I>&gt;<i>     Squid cannot splice the SSL connection any more.
</I>&gt;<i>   - ban bump on step3 if peek is selected on step2 and
</I>&gt;<i>     Squid cannot bump the connection any more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What about the other documented actions:
 * &quot;reconnect&quot; at step 1 &amp; 2
 * &quot;none&quot; at step 2 and 3

(&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>&gt;)

&gt;<i> The same action filtering mechanism may be useful for other ACL-driven
</I>&gt;<i> directives with state-dependent custom actions.
</I>
So far that is only AUTH_REQUIRED on all non-http_access directives. And
DUNNO results on fast-check access controls.

The former would be a good (quick?) followup patch. The latter will
require careful testing and documentation.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This change adds a runtime performance overhead of a single virtual
</I>&gt;<i> method call to all ORed ACLs that do not use banned actions. That method
</I>&gt;<i> itself just returns false unless the ACL represents a whole directive
</I>&gt;<i> rule. In the latter case, an std::vector size() is also checked. It is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to avoid this overhead by adding a boolean &quot;I may ban actions&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> flag to Acl::OrNode, but we decided the small performance harm is not
</I>&gt;<i> worth the extra code to set that flag.
</I>
Agreed.


So the audit:

in src/acl/Tree.cc:

* src/Checklist.h and include/Checklist.h do not exist.
 - did you mean #include &quot;acl/Checklist.h&quot; ?


in src/cache_cf.cc:

* revert all changes

NP: you may also want to test how ssl_bump works when the admin has
configures &quot;tls_outgoing_options disable&quot; or a min-version value higher
than the server will accept.


in src/client_side.cc:

* not banning other non-available options (see comment above about none
and reconnect).

* looks like httpsSslBumpStep2AccessCheckDone() is still making bad
assumptions about &quot;none&quot; action == &quot;splice&quot;. When its documented as
being not available at step 2 &amp; 3.
 - also reconnect action is actually performed? at step2 when documented
as not available until step3.


in src/ssl/PeerConnector.cc:

* Ssl::PeekingPeerConnector::checkForPeekAndSpliceDone() is another
point doing none == splice when PeekingConnector is != step1 right?
being a server/peer job it should only be step2 or step3.

* the Must() will throw on receiving final action &quot;reconnect&quot; which is
documented as being most relevant here on peer connections.
 - if that is actually right for ths bit of code please add a comment to
document why.
