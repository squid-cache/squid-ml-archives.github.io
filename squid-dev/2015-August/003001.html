&quot;reconnect&quot; is not an [unused] BumpMode enum value (I only checked trunk
though). Sorry about my &quot;terminate&quot; typo in the previous response.


I am just trying to explain that the situation with &quot;reconnect&quot; is a
minor problem: Trunk code is fine. Squid.conf.documentation is fine.
AFAIK, no user has suffered from misinterpreting the wiki page. Yes, the
wiki page wording is unfortunate and should be changed. That's all!


If you reread your original reaction to the &quot;reconnect is not yet
implemented&quot; news, you will see that it is easy to misinterpret(?) your
reaction as a request to implement &quot;reconnect&quot; in order to fix some big
problem that we should be all very upset about. That
misinterpretation(?) is the reason I posted an explanation. There is
absolutely no need to turn this misunderstanding(?) into yet another
time-wasting thread.

For the future, avoiding unqualified pronouns in isolated
paragraph-sentences may help a lot. It is often very difficult to know
what &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, or &quot;it&quot; refers to because a lot of things above an
isolated sentence can be &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;. For example, saying &quot;Please
remove reconnect documentation from the wiki page&quot; would have saved a
lot of time. This exchange is just one of many such instances.


&gt;<i> 0. Complete removal of the action entry from wiki.
</I>
Done. I have removed wiki documentation for the unsupported &quot;err&quot; action
as well.

Alex.
