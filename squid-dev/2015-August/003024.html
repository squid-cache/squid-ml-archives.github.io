It's then gcc/ldd setup:

If I take out the -flto option from CFLAGS (I can leave in the
-fuse-linker-plugin, but I don't think it can do anything in the absence of
-flto) it links.

While it says if you don't use -flto and -fuse-linker-plugin to use
-fwhole-program --- then I get a different class of errors -- items defined
but unused -- the opposite of the undefined case.

To be clear &quot;-flto&quot; was in my CFLAGS (and LDFLAGS) -- if I take that out
it links...   But I wonder what the -with-flto, etc options that squid
has in its configure do if I don't specify the -flto option in CFLAGS..

But that's it (dunno if the binary works or not, but can try that next).

Sorry, but I find the squid build among the more complicated things I 
build myself (but it doesn't have the worst config procedure)  I admit
the new samba4 build looks daunting... but samba3 was a piece of cake.

 One of the main confusions -- on some of the switches if you
DON't disabled them, it will try to build all the helpers in a dir..  Vs.
others, will build none -- unless they are specified.   That wasn't @ fault
in the final analysis here, but that certainly could be a bit more consistent?

Try adding &quot;-flto&quot; to your CFLAGS and see how it affects your build...vs
-fwhole-program.  gcc manpage says if you aren't using the lto, to use
the whole-program, so it can do best job/unit... but I just upgraded to
the 4.9 series...so who know, may have some kinks.

Thanks for at least looking at this!

	By using the disable/enable/with/without switches.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The rest of the code is not optional.

	I wouldn't know what switch to use to configure that.

cheers
