Each Feature has a Status attribute that is supposed to describe the
feature state. If that attribute does not work well (for whatever
reason), then a dedicated directory is unlikely to work well either. A
Status attribute can reflect more than two states and does not require
changing feature URLs, so it feels like the attribute is a better
solution than a dedicated directory, even if it does not work well.

I really doubt things [not] written on wiki prevent us from helping each
other.

As for the Priority field itself, it can only be interpreted/compared
correctly in a context of Features created by the same developer, so its
Project-wide utility cannot be high indeed. I try to set it accurately
on my pages, but (as anything on wiki) it is often stale, and I do not
know whether anybody has been actually using that information.

Your Priority side note seems to be unrelated to your Feature placement
proposal.


&gt;<i> * I propose adding a section &quot;Blueprints/&quot; or &quot;Wishlist/&quot; to contain
</I>&gt;<i> what is now the Features pages for projects which are either just
</I>&gt;<i> describing wishlist outlines, or developer-only projects and not
</I>&gt;<i> actually user visible features of Squid.
</I>&gt;<i>  To be moved to Features/ when the page is re-written with final
</I>&gt;<i> end-user feature documentation.
</I>
I believe Status attribute is a better approach for the reasons stated
in the first paragraph of my response, but if others think otherwise, I
will just follow their lead when creating new pages. This is not
important IMO.


&gt;<i> I also re-propose an old suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * That we make the ProgrammerGuide/ (or &quot;Developers/&quot; ?) section
</I>&gt;<i> actually the how-to documents for developers instead of just an outdated
</I>&gt;<i> FAQ copy on how squid-2 ('ish) code works.
</I>
There is some Squid3-relevant stuff in there (e.g., ClientStreams), but
I do not know whether anybody is actually using it. IMHO, if you do not
delete the old stuff, you can add whatever new documentation you think
is useful, including how-to documents for developers.


HTH,

Alex.
