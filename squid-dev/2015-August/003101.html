</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the attached patch (a merge request from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lp:~kinkie/squid/mempools-nozero) changes MEMPROXY_CLASS so that it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; zero memory before releasing it to requestors. The constructors of all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes using that feature were checked, so that they fully initialize
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data members and thus require no zeroing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It also changes Debug::OutStream to use MEMPROXY_CLASS instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new/derelete, and changes constructors to initializer lists whenever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible and sensible (aka justified by other changes), same for dropping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HERE and adopting nullptr.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It also changes some code in Makefile.am to use make variables in place
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; full paths.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The code has been run-tested (default config only), build-farm-tested and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; polygraph-tested. It shows a small but noticeable performance improvement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in performance (of course, numbers are to be taken with a big grain of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; salt).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When reviewing, please do not focus on formatting issues; if this patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passes review I'll run a source-formatting before merging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * in Makefiles please add the new bits of *_SOURCE lists in alphabetical
</I>&gt;<i> order.
</I>&gt;<i>  - you have several stub_libmem.cc going after stub_M and stub_S*
</I>&gt;<i> filenames.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I fixed them. It was mentioned in the coverity-fixes thread that it
could be a good idea to do a formatting round sorting all entries in
Makefiles, once the updated standards are finalized. I'd defer any leftover
unsorted entries till then.


&gt;<i> * Please make the initializer lists one member per line.
</I>&gt;<i>  - the auto-formatting wont do that for us yet.
</I>&gt;<i>  - it greatly helps readability and manual checking for missing or
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-order items. We can also then easily add comments to lines
</I>&gt;<i> explain odd default values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure for .cc, not so sure for .h, where compactness helps readability and
presence and order should be easier to spot. Finally, many missing or
out-of-order should get caught either by Coverity or gcc.
Changed for all .cc, not done for .h (where lists are quite shorter)

* in memset() please use 0 integer value not '\0' to set flags.
&gt;<i>  - it helps the compiler know it is safe to optimize up to larger than
</I>&gt;<i> 8-bit values of 0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.


&gt;<i> * in MemObject::MemObject() please leave the _reply initialization like
</I>&gt;<i> it was so that the HTTMSGLOCK hack is kept visibly associated with the
</I>&gt;<i> new operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.


&gt;<i> * You add several &quot;// needs mempool-managed zeroing.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  - but you say this patch makes the MEMPROXYC_CLASS macro do zero-ing
</I>&gt;<i> already. Those should be reverted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The commets are wrong and based on an outdated analysis of StoreMeta.
Removed the comments.


&gt;<i> * src/HttpHeader.cc - revert
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> * when adding a new constructor ensure the big-5 operators (ctor, dtor,
</I>&gt;<i> assign, emplace, emplace-assign) are all present. Even if they use &quot;=
</I>&gt;<i> default&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  - looking at StoreMeta, maybe others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
StoreMeta is pure-virtual; Also, it has no complex members so emplace
doesn't add value vs. copy.
Omitting emplace and implementing the others as protected for completeness'
sake.


&gt;<i> * wordlist missing 'explicit' on the raw-pointer ctor
</I>&gt;<i>  - also other big-5 operators
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
wordlist must die; it's a C relic which doesn't belong to squid anymore.
Kinda-implemented with a private default destructor (friended by
wordlistDestroy) and deleted assignment and copyconstructor. This helped
catch a leak in FtpGateway.cc so at least it was used for something -even
if it's very ugly.


&gt;<i> * in test-suite/Makefile.am please try to avoid adding LIBMEM_STUBS.
</I>&gt;<i> - DEBUG_SOURCE entries should be enough, and it doesnt matter of extra
</I>&gt;<i> stubs get linked to unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Done in a different way: some unit tests need the full libmem.la; the stub
symbols would override the library, causing failures.


&gt;<i> * please do one of these:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  + return the XXX to Debugs.h, but it can move up to explain why
</I>&gt;<i> AllocatorProxy.h is used instead of mem/forward.h
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It doesn't need to. I'm dumb and should have used mem/forward in the first
place - you had even told me not too long ago.

Revised patch (with huge context, hence the big size) attached.

Thanks
