Thank you.

We agreed to change these things when the line itself *or the code
around it* was being changed. So the whole hunk changed as a
design-change unit instead of two or more patches.
 In my audit I allowed polishing where the function/method was short or
the line was between two other code changes.


I still believe we need to do these as flag-day in trunk just before
branching a new version.

Once those are over we face a LOT less wasted time arguing and auditing
around them. As it stands we face the pain from 2011 to X+10 from
whatever future date X any given line is changed. We could have been
halfway over that long-tail portion of HERE by now, with only the very
oldest version backports being an issue. And only an issue for those who
are actively *paid* to do those ancient ports (plus me), not submission
pain lumped on all the volunters trying to work with current versions.

Where the code design itself has changed the patch needs a re-write
anyway and polishing hunks are insignificant against that.

Where the code design has not changed the portage part of pain is still
the smallest part. Just a few hunks that bzr puts in the wrong location
and needs seconds/minutes manually moving. bzr itself takes care of the
hunk locations just fine. That is the kind of &quot;pain&quot; that IMO is better
to have at a fixed known location (version boundary), which can be
noted, than to have occuring on every portage attempt to any version.

3.5 -&gt; 4 is a better place for flag-days then other versinos have been,
since I/we have to rebuild 3.5 on every backport with -std=c++98 anyway
just to make sure nothing kills it at the language level. Its already a
pre-marked pain point for better reasons than polish.
