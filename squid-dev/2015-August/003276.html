Unfortunately not if we want to proceed with MEMPROXY_CLASS conversion,
which doesn't expose that method, and MEMPROXY_CLASS is with this branch
the easiest (I would dare to say standard) way to go to non-zeroing pools.

I've tried to figure out the code some more; comments highlight that it's
an optimization feature, which is only effective with the chunked allocator
- it is otherwise a nop.
I believe this hint its is meant to try and alter the behavior of the
chunked allocator - in a roundabout way - hinting that the objects in the
pool are important and thus to try and make that particular object pool
less sensitive to memory pressure, by ensuring that if even a single
StoreEntry can be allocated, there will be at least (chunk_size/obj_size
-1) available memory areas until all of them have been released.

Maybe we could test the effects of this optimization by setting a low
memory_pools_limit, but then whatever gap in performance would probably be
dwarfed by fallback to malloc when allocating other objects due to the
pressure.

In other words, I suspect that whatever is the optimization value of chunk
size setting, it is dwarfed by other effects and is speculative; at the
same time we have a sure gain by not initializing objects twice (one when
zeroing the pool, and then in the constructor).
For this reason, I would like to go ahead with the merge, I agree it's a
good idea to isolate this patch into a separate commit, and to mark it as
potentially performance-impacting in the commit message.

Please let me know if you agree.
