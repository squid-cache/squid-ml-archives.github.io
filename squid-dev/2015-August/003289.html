If you can avoid the problem by exposing and using that method, I think
that would be a good solution.


&gt;<i> I've tried to figure out the code some more; comments highlight that

</I>&gt;<i> I believe this hint its is meant to try and alter the behavior of the

</I>&gt;<i> single StoreEntry can be allocated, there will be at least
</I>&gt;<i> (chunk_size/obj_size -1) available memory areas until all of them have

</I>

&gt;<i> ... I suspect that whatever is the optimization value of

</I>&gt;<i> at the same time we have a sure gain by not initializing objects twice

</I>&gt;<i> For this reason, I would like to go ahead with the merge, I agree it's a

&gt;<i> Please let me know if you agree.
</I>

I may not agree with some of the above statements, but I do not object
to this change going in (in a dedicated commit) if you think that is the
best way forward (and others do not object).


Thank you,

Alex.
