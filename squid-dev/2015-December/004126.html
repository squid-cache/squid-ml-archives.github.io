It makes them &quot;maybe&quot;, no, yes.

Though I am still not convinced exactly that squid.conf is the right
place. As I said before:
&quot;
In general if a setting is not something that can have a reasonable
temporary default for a while, then be switched around in realtime. Then
squid.conf is not a good place for it.

I would make it mandatory on &quot;-k check&quot; (but not -k parse). Optional
through a command line parameter on all other runs. (Remember we have
long-args possible now so no need to squeeze it into a gap.)
&quot;

Which is *not* doing mlock by default (retaining current behaviour). The
slowdown then only happens on -k check, which is the manual test to
check for problems. If mlock has a problem, a FATAL debugs (maybe exit
too, but could keep going to find other errors) during the test run is
very appropriate.

The other (default / normal) runs having it OFF by default, since the -k
check should have confirmed already that it is going to work. Unless the
admin explicitly sets the config / command line option to ON. In which
case complaints of slowdown are unjustified, and they can be told to
disable again.


&gt;<i> My plan was to tell them to disable mlock() (via a new squid.conf
</I>&gt;<i> directive) if all of the items below apply to them:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (a) mlock() is successful now
</I>&gt;<i> (b) they are reasonably sure no environment or configuration changes
</I>&gt;<i>     will make mlock() unsuccessful (if it is re-enabled) without them
</I>&gt;<i>     knowing about the problem
</I>&gt;<i> (c) mlock() slows things down too much in their setup
</I>&gt;<i> (d) they want to trade faster startup for micro delays during runtime
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Which seems to me all the things a -k check execution run will be
testing for naturally. So if mlock errors are fatal on -k check, they
get alerted to fix it before the running process is signalled to restart
with the new config.
