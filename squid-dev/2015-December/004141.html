</I>

I think the post-event warning is better:

* It is difficult to guess which segment sizes will cause significant
delays in a given environment.

* Squid allocates many segments and a few large segments. Warning the
admin before each large allocation would create a lot of noise. Not
warning the admin before some large allocations would kind of defeat the
idea of the preemptive warning itself.

* There is a possibility that the significant (from admin point of view)
startup delay is caused by the _cumulative_ effect of locking various
shared memory segments and not by any single segment.

* Warning folks about something that has not happened yet and may never
happen increases log noise. In this particular case, we _can_ warn when
we know that startup was significantly delayed because of locking,
reducing that noise.

* There is a good chance that somebody concerned about startup delays
will notice the first line printed _after_ the delay.


Are you sure that preemptive per-segment warnings are better than an
acknowledgement of the problem after it happens? Do you think the latter
is likely to be missed by admins investigating startup delays?


&gt;<i> and then when it's done &quot;shared memory locking of X Mb done in Y

</I>&gt;<i> area&quot;.
</I>
I would rather put explanations in squid.conf.documented so that we do
not have to risk misleading folks when discussing complex issues using a
one-line statement. Besides, we need to point folks to options
controlling this behavior (in case they do not think that slow startup
is &quot;normal&quot; for them).


Thank you,

Alex.
