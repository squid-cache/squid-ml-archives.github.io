The suggested names were protocol-neutral AFAICT.

</I>
I doubt you can have a generic reservation algorithm without knowing
what the reservation is for (i.e. &quot;reading&quot; of some sort), but
calcBufferSpaceToReserve() is indeed better than the original
needBufferSpace() on other levels.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> +    /// parse scan to find the mime headers block for current

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Find is a usually a const method. This method does a lot more than

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the method name does not already reveal, I would do:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /// returns whether the header was successfully parsed bool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parseMimeHeader(const char *headerKind, const size_t sizeLimit);
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do object to the use of &quot;header&quot; other than as a modifier to the
</I>&gt;<i> named mime block type like I had it.
</I>
Please feel free to insert missing MIME augmentation as needed, of course.


&gt;<i> Would you accept &quot;identify&quot; instead of &quot;find&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i>  or maybe &quot;grab&quot; is better?
</I>
Out of those two, &quot;grab&quot; or &quot;isolate&quot; is better IMO. &quot;Parse&quot; would be
even better because parsing is exactly what this method is doing
(despite all the disclaimers to the contrary :-).


&gt;&gt;<i> but there is more that needs to be done in the above code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> +    // Squid could handle these headers, but admin does not want
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to +    if (messageHeaderSize() &gt;= limit) { +        debugs(33,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5, &quot;Too large &quot; &lt;&lt; which); +        parseStatusCode =
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Http::scHeaderTooLarge; +        return false; +    }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This should be rewritten to go before we initialize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mimeHeaderBlock_ IMO. Otherwise, the damage of keeping the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> admin-prohibited header is already done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NP: This will prevent the ERR_TOO_BIG and cache.log level 11,2
</I>&gt;<i> displaying the mime block as part of the message when its present but
</I>&gt;<i> outside the desired size range.
</I>
I am sure there is a way to have ERR_TOO_BIG and cache.log level 11,2
messages on huge messages if we want that. Parser polishing you are
working on should not prevent that.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * This has now had several hours of regular web browsing by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> myself (YouTube, Facebook, some news sites, and the Squid sites)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with nothing noticably going wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any ICAP tests? The HTTP-ICAP interaction has been a source of many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bugs before and your patch changes the relevant code. If you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not tested it, please do (or ask others to do it).
</I>
&gt;<i> No the ICAP related code is not touched. It still uses the HttpMsg
</I>&gt;<i> parser functions and its own original buffering. These changes only
</I>&gt;<i> touch the server socket (virgin reply) buffer I/O and parse function.
</I>
The patch contains/changes adaptation-related code. I am not talking
about parsing ICAP messages, but about coordination between HTTP code
and ICAP/eCAP code. Anything inside USE_ADAPTATION.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Polygraph shows a 7 RPS performance loss (0.36%), with trunk
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having +/-2 RPS (0.1%) normal fluctuation. I believe this is from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the transitional regression to data-copy into MemBuf for chunked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> coding.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Did Polygraph actually use chunked responses in these tests?
</I>
&gt;<i> Unsure, but I think so.
</I>
I suspect it did not. If I read the code correctly, Polygraph supports
dechunking of received responses but does not chunk the messages it
sends (because Polygraph knows their size). We will add that support!


Cheers,

Alex.
