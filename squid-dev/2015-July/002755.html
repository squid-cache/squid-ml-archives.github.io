</I>
The fake connect request was not &quot;received over TLS&quot;.
Conceptually it was a plain-TCP SYN received prior to TLS. No different
in meaning to the non-fake CONNECT requests.

Anyhow ...

&gt;<i> adaptation_access icapS aclIcap
</I>&gt;<i> adaptation_access icapN !aclIcap
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> aclIcap can be a received_encrypted ACL. What ACL expression would you
</I>&gt;<i> suggest for aclIcap if received_encrypted is not available?
</I>

  # top 5 criteria - TLS transactions
  acl aclIcap allof HTTPS

  # last 1 - the fake-CONNECTs but not the regular CONNECTs:
  acl bumpPorts myportname port2 port4
  acl aclIcap allof CONNECT !bumpPorts



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC, the deployed configuration (before received_encrypted was
</I>&gt;<i> implemented) used &quot;all&quot; ACL for aclIcap because the admin could not come
</I>&gt;<i> up with anything much better using existing ACLs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2a. claim that the false-positive scenarios found by Amos are either

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know what false positives you are talking about specifically,

False-negative:

Imagine that icapN was REQMOD and icapS a RESPMOD service. With
URL-rewrite, eCAP or such modification of the reply making it <A HREF="https://">https://</A>
(tainted).

Using received_encrypted the transactions;
 during request will match, so icapN does not get used.
 during reply will not match, so icapS does not get used.


False-positive:

 Imagine that icapS was REQMOD and icapN a RESPMOD service. Same
modifications by url-rewriter. This time re-writing to <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URL
matching cached content.

Using received_encrypted the transactions;
 during request will match, so icapS gets used.
 during reply will *still match*, so icapN does not get used
