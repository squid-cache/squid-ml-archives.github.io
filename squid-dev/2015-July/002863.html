Hi,
  no rambling, it's ok.
Actually, the performance improvement is just a nice byproduct, that's not
the objective at all, as I tried explaining in the merge proposal.
The actual problem I was addressing is the multiple C casts used to try and
coerce anything resembling a map&lt;const char *, int&gt; into an http/1 header
table, simply because there is code in squid which implements that map as a
header table (and rather naively, at that - linear scan is SO fifties ;) ).

In fact, I argue that the proposed version is actually simpler than the
previous code; it can maybe even be simplified further but not much
further, let's go over it a bit toghether if you want.

struct HttpDigestFieldAttrs is there simply to have a convenient
representation of the header table DigestAttrs. It makes no attempt to be
anything different. Can it be turned into
GenericInitializerFromStringTo&lt;enum foo&gt; ? Yes. Is it worth it for 3 LOC?
not so sure.

DigestFieldslookupTable_t is probably what you are lashing out at, I bet.
Yes, it could be made generic and templatized to represent a
SBuf-to-anything with a static table initializer. I haven't tried that as
that may be PMO and it may preclude turning the index from a map to an
unordered_map with a table-specific hasher (gperf-generated or
hand-written, it's rather trivial to do it in this and in many other cases
we care about).
Doing that with a generic would be harder, require roughly about as much
code, and for a &lt;20-LOC class, would probably be overdesign.

The patch has been build-tested successfully on all platforms we care
about, and run-tested (refactoring went in two phases: add new code,
assert() that it behaves like the old code and run-test, rip old code out).

IMVHO HttpHeaderFieldAttrs is poor legacy, and deserves a thankful and
merciful eviction from our code-base :)
