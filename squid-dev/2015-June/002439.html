Thank you. I've had this on my todo list for a long time.

One problem though...

The parse operations documented as being copied from http.cc
processReplyHeader() do not match what trunk currently does for HTTP
replies in that function.

Specifically HttpReply::parse is deprecated and not to be used in new
code. We now have an Http1::ReplyParser instead that processes the
status-line and grabs the mime headers into a SBuf blob for writing out
if necessary. That is all tunnel.cc needs right now for this patches
parse step.
