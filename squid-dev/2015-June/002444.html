This is not right. Squid should be identifying the message as
non-HTTP/1.x (which it isn't due to the URI syntax violation) and
treating it as such.

There is no reason for HTTP/0.9 traffic to hang (thus the bug
agreement). Squid should read in the first line, find a reply for the
URI and close the connection once that reply is delivered. Note how
thare are no mime headers involved to be waited on. I agree there is a
bug there if its hanging.

NP: it means &quot;broken&quot; syntax does work - but gets a slow response with
no HTTP feature benefits. That slow vs fast is the designed incentive
for such softwares authors to fix things.

&gt;<i>

</I>
The *proper* long term fix is to obey the standards in regard to message
syntax so applications stop using these invalid (when un-encoded)
characters and claiming HTTP/1.1 support.
