After your patch that makes the master file the one writing the PID file
what are the workers (non-master) doing writing to it?

</I>

I think I understand you there. You mean this process:

 enter_suid()
 ...
 watch_child()
  ...
  writePidFile() {
   enter_squid() // no-op
   ...
   leave_suid()
 }
 ... something that needs suid. oops.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we want to fix master process to not run in suid mode, but I believe:
</I>&gt;<i>   - This is not a scope for this patch
</I>&gt;<i>   - The master process does not do a lot of thinks. Probably we do not

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, more than possible - probable that somebody will or is already
doing so. Just the other day I saw someone running workers with
different PID files.
Thats the kind of thing that happens with these directives available in
via squid.conf per-worker.


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your description sounds like some part of the code in worker scope is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using enter_suid doing a lot of Squid stuff - plus incidentally some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> root system stuff, then leave_suid. That is broken code. None of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general &quot;Squid stuff&quot; are security sentitive system calls needing root
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privileges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, please forget the workers. This patch does not change anything in a
</I>&gt;<i> worker.
</I>&gt;<i> Please take a look into the writePidFile function, and into watch_child
</I>&gt;<i> function (which implements the master process)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The place your patch is changing are all in the workers code.

Instead of moving the enter_suid() outside of writePidFile() in several
places the master code should call enter only to preserve the part of
code *it* needs suid. eg.

 watch_child()
   ...
   writePidFile()
   enter_suid(); // writePidFile() uses leave_suid()
   ...

Much simpler patch, and fewer places overall using enter/leave_suid.
