There is approximately 8-18 months &quot;year&quot; between series releases now. A
very arbitrary choice whenever it seems reasonable to release a batch of
features. My undertanding of the proposal stated was that we keep that
current practice, but dropping the 2-part &quot;3.x&quot; numeric down to a single
part.


Its already clear from past discussions that our views of &quot;feature&quot; are
very different. If we bumped the version with each &quot;new thing&quot;  ...

 ... last month we had non-trivial feature changes (100+ Lines of code)
on the 26th, 22nd, and some lesser (25+ LOC) but still widely user
visible new thing on the 11th and 1st, and large-ish but not user
visible feature changes across the 1st-5th and 19th.
 That would be 4-8 major releases of Squid within the month of Feb 2015.

</I>
I'm not searching for excuses. There is a meta-pattern of previous major
numbers changing roughly when the language is changed. Roughly because
it is +/- a few years and the next &quot;new&quot; language this time around can
build anything 3.3+ AFAIK, while the &quot;old&quot; language can't build new
tarballs - and there is precedence in the last changover there too with
C++ tools building C code fine but _not_ vice-versa.

I'm seeking opinions. On whether we continue with that pattern in
conjunction with the coming trunk activity, or discard it in favour of
something else - even if that something else is slipping down the slope
towards an eventual 3.999 series (haven't heard anyone advocating for
that though).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The disadvantage is in removing a concept of &quot;major upgrade pains&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> the often real boundaries associated with it. For example, it would be
</I>&gt;<i> more difficult for you to explain that jumping from 11.4 to 12.4
</I>&gt;<i> requires a week of system administration and testing work while going
</I>&gt;<i> from 11.4 to 21.4 does not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can still have LTS-like releases, of course. The versioning scheme
</I>&gt;<i> does not affect that at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are quite a lot of infrastructure changes involved with that big a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change, and its not entirely clear how the beta releases would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> represented - perhapse not having any beta releases at all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As Kinkie have said, you can apply the current solution for beta
</I>&gt;<i> releases by adding an extra number after zero. For the release.patch
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, betas would look like release.0.patch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remain to be skeptical about the advertised correlation between our
</I>&gt;<i> initial stable releases and actual, real-world stability. Our official
</I>&gt;<i> beta process seems to mislead as much as it informs. Thus, I welcome
</I>&gt;<i> experiments that would get rid of that process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of the day, versioning does not really matter much IMO. The
</I>&gt;<i> important things are stability and timeliness (i.e., release delay for
</I>&gt;<i> features in trunk) of our releases.
</I>&gt;<i>

Thank you for the feedback.
