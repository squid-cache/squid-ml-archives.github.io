Which mode? bump or splice or peek-then-bump or peek-then-splice mode?

The valid operations are different in each combination of operations.

bump mode is equivalent to the old client-first. Where squid is
generating teh whole certificate chain sent to the client.

splice or peek-then-splice modes are both equivalent to not bumping at
all. Squid is expected to pass on exactly what the server emits, no
matter how screwed.

peek-then-bump is equivalent to server-first mode. Where the
certificates generated by Squid are expected to mimic what the server
sent. The full chain is only expected IF the server sent its whole chain.

Yes, but only if one misinterprets the primary use case. AFAICT after
rereading the original pconn_lifetime thread, this misinterpretation has
started from the very beginning and, apparently, has not quite ended
yet. The feature limits the total lifetime of a connection, but it is
applied to idle persistent connections only.

Yes, the limit should affect idle persistent connections only. We tried
to expand the definition of "idle" and "persistent" to cover more use
cases (in part, to accommodate squid-dev review comments IIRC), but the
real world was against us. For example, terminating connections between
pipelined requests caused interoperability problems even though they are
not supposed to happen with compliant HTTP clients. I suspect HTTP/2
solves this problem, but we are not there yet.

I would not be surprised to see more fixes in this direction. For
example, we have an untriaged bug report about FTP control connections
being negatively affected, with an argument that FTP does not have a
concept of "idle" and so should not be the subject to pconn_lifetime limits.


Cheers,

Alex.

Peek then bump! Apologies, I was incredibly unclear on that.

The scenario this patch addresses is when Squid is configured with an
intermediate signing CA certificate, and clients have the root CA
installed on their machines. What happens is that the generated
certificates come down with an unknown issuer (the intermediate
signing certificate), with no intermediates, so they are rejected. By
adding the configured certificate chain as old client-first mode did,
the intermediate and root certificates come down as well, resulting in
the issuer being identified and the connection being established
"securely".

[Christos Tsantilas] Squid Assertion Read.cc:205: "params.data == data"

Inside IdleConnList::findUseable the IdleConnList::removeAt call can delete
"this" IdleConnList object. The IdleConnList::clearHandlers called imediatelly
after the removeAt method, will try to use the invalid "this" object in
a comm_read_cancel function call, causing this assertion or other similar.

This patch fixes the IdleConnList::findUseable, IdleConnList::pop and
IdleConnList::findAndClose methods to call IdleConnList::clearHandlers before
the IdleConnList::removeAt is called.

This is a Measurement Factory project

[Christos Tsantilas] Squid Assertion errorpage.cc:600: "entry->isEmpty()"

While squid shuting down, aborted transactions, for which body data already
downloaded, can cause this bug.

This is a Measurement Factory project

[Christos Tsantilas] Squid Assertion MemBuf.cc:380: "new_cap > (size_t) capacity"

The maximum buffer size for holding Server and Client SSL hello messages is only
16k which is not enough hold a Hello message which includes some extensions and
1-2 or more Certificates.
This patch increases the maximum size to 65535 and also adds some checks to
avoid squid crashes in the case the hello messages buffer overflows.

[Christos Tsantilas] Secure ICAP

This patch adds support for ICAP services that require SSL/TLS transport
connections. The same options used for the cache_peer directive are used for
the icap_service directive, with similar certificate validation logic.

To mark an ICAP service as "secure", use an "icaps://" service URI scheme when
listing your service via an icap_service directive. The industry is using a
"Secure ICAP" term, and Squid follows that convention, but "icaps" seems more
appropriate for a _scheme_ name.

Squid uses port 11344 for Secure ICAP by default, following another popular
proxy convention. The old 1344 default for plain ICAP ports has not changed.


Technical Details
==================

This patch:
- Splits Ssl::PeerConnector class into Ssl::PeerConnector parent and two kids:
Ssl::BlindPeerConnector, a basic SSL connector for cache_peers, and
Ssl::PeekingPeerConnector, a peek-and-splice SSL connector for HTTP servers.

- Adds a third Ssl::IcapPeerConnector kid to connect to Secure ICAP servers.

- Fixes ErrorState class to avoid crashes on nil ErrorState::request member.
(Ssl::IcapPeerConnector may generate an ErrorState with a nil request).

- Modifies the ACL peername to use the Secure ICAP server name as value while
connecting to an ICAP server. This is useful to make SSL certificate
policies based on ICAP server name. However, this change is undocumented
until we decide whether a dedicated ACL would be better.

[Amos Jeffries] Make pod2man an optional dependency

Documentation files can be built on a best-effort basis. This allows
Squid more helpers to be built without pod2man and sub-dependencies.

configure.ac already checks for pod2man existence and sets appropriate
automake conditionals.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Fix broken build with musl libc (caused by
	sys/signal.h)
Message-ID: <1430992792-12335-1-git-send-email-alexinbeijing@gmail.com>

When included, musl libc's sys/signal.h issues a compiler warning
stating that signal.h should be used directly instead. If gcc is
treating all warnings as errors, this breaks the build.

glibc's sys/signal.h does not contain any definitions; all it does
is include signal.h (indirectly). So directly including signal.h
doesn't break anything with glibc.

Subject: [squid-dev] Death of SSLv3
Message-ID: <554B388C.20107@treenet.co.nz>

Its done. SSLv3 is now a "MUST NOT use" protocol from RFC 7525
(<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525>)

It's time for us to start ripping out from trunk all features and hacks
supporting its use. Over the coming days I will be submitting patches to
remove the squid.conf settings, similar to SSLv2 removal earlier.

The exceptions which may remain are SSLv3 features which are used by the
still-supported TLS versions. Such as session resume, and the SSLv3
format of Hello message (though not the SSLv3 protocol IDs).

Christos, if you can keep this in mind for all current / pending, and
future "SSL" work.

Amos

are you sure you want to do this _now_ ?

It is predictable that users will complain with
"I know this provider is stupid and uses SSLv3 but I _need_ to access that site for our business"
and use this as a reason not to upgrade or blame squid.

It may not be that much extra work to have a new option "use_sslv3" with the default setting to OFF
and not ripping SSLv3 code yet.  Also, if you do not rip SSLv3, Squid can detect that a site uses
SSLv3 and give a useful error message like "this site insists in using the unsafe SSLv3 protocol"
instead of a confusing "unknown protocol".

No, it is not time yet. Too many folks still use SSL and cannot switch
to TLS just because a "best current practice" document recommends that
they do. User needs trump RFC compliance in this case.

Sorry for the lag. Looks better than before.

NP: I'm holding off on approving until I can clear up whats happened to
IPv6 in 3.5.4. I'm pretty certain its a side effect of the errno changes
altering Squids state assumptions when IPv6 fails.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Refactor IcmpConfig
Message-ID: <554C726C.9090109@treenet.co.nz>

Pull the IcmpConfig object out of the global SquidConfig structure and
updates it to processing its own parse logics. Bringing it inline with
the per-component configuration design in SourceLayout and HotConf projects.

This allows us to use SBuf for storing the pinger program details and
avoid valgrind complaints about some malloc.

It will also allow lazy re-starting of the helper to be implemented later.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Consistently apply notes from cached external
	ACL replies
Message-ID: <CAGUJm7YX7mq-kOjtL-NjAboMa4QZJ2QC=Hmi=Td9V79vUwmPVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Attached is a patch that adds notes from cached ACL helpers to request objects.

Without this patch, when you have an external ACL that replies with
notes, they are only added onto the HTTP request that kicked off the
external ACL lookup, and not cached ACL responses. This means if you
set notes from an external ACL that are used for some processing in
other ACLs, or post-processing on logs, things may be missed.

To illustrate what I mean...

external_acl_type foo %DST /path/to/fakehelper.py
acl foo external foo
http_access allow foo

logformat foolog %ru %note %et
access_log /path/to/access.log foolog

fakehelper is a script that always replies with "OK tag=fromacl
foo=bar bar=baz".

Access log prior to the patch:

http://google.com/ foo:%20bar%0D%0Atag:%20fromacl%0D%0Abar:%20baz%0D%0A fromacl
http://google.com/ - fromacl

Access log after the patch:

http://google.com/ foo:%20bar%0D%0Atag:%20fromacl%0D%0Abar:%20baz%0D%0A fromacl
http://google.com/ foo:%20bar%0D%0Atag:%20fromacl%0D%0Abar:%20baz%0D%0A fromacl

Thank you,

Nathan.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] comm_connect_addr on failures return Comm:OK
Message-ID: <554CDCAD.7050809@users.sourceforge.net>


I found the following problem in squid-trunk and squid-3.5:

   - Squid calls peer_select to retrieve server destinations addresses
   - The peer_select returns two ip addresses, the first is an ipv6 
address the second one is an ipv4.
   - The FwdState creates a Comm::ConnOpener object which fails to 
connect to the first address, but returns Comm:OK.
   -The FwdState calls Ssl::PeerConnector, which fails to establish SSL 
on a non opened connection, and return an error page to the user.

I am attaching a small patch which fixes the problem.

I believe that this is the problem reported by some users, that the 
sslbumping does not work in squid-3.5 and later.

Regards,
     Christos

Damn. Kicking myself over missing that one. Thank you.


I've taken the liberty of also restructuring those if-statements along
with this fix and adding a missing errno reset.
 Applied to trunk as rev.14065.


Thank you!

Okay. Christos has resolved that now.


in src/comm/Read.cc:

* guidelines for errno usage state that it needs to be cleared (
errno=0) before the function being monitored so that values from
previous syscalls do not leak across.
 - so the line errno = 0; before FD_READ_METHOD needs to be retained.

* xerrno can be initialized just before its needed, and at the same time
errno is reset. like so:
  int xerrno = errno = 0;

* given the above two changes the redundant if(retval < 0) wrapping
xerrno assignment can be removed. Just copy the errno to xerrno
unconditionally.
 - we treat xerrno as if it were errno from that point onwards. The
requirements of only checking errno if there was an error transfer to
xerrno.


in src/comm/TcpAcceptor.cc:

* there is a reset of errno=0 which is still missing and not

* the use of xstrerror() needs converting to xstrerr(errcode)


in src/comm/Write.cc:

* follow the same pattern as for src/comm/Read.cc with xerrno
initialized at the last moment and when resetting errno, errno copied to
it unconditionally, etc.

* also xstrerror() repalcement with xstrerr(xerrno) in the relevant
debugs lines
 - the ' << "."' suffix output can be dropped on those lines as well
 - (plus opportunistic removal of HERE macros on the changed lines.)


Also, I await answer on my earlier question of whether you were
interested / intending to do a larger (full?) audit of errno usage and
removal of xstrerror() ?
 I would like to get work on that underway ASAP, if you are not
intending to take it on I would like to know so I can start it myself.

Cheers

If there are no objections I would like to merge this branch to trunk.

Note that it will cement in the C++11 requirement. Causing RHEL 6 and
CentOS 6 builds of *trunk* (Squid-4) to require manual compiler installs
of GCC 4.9.

I was holding back due to the above annoyance factor. The reason for
current push being that GCC 5 / stdlib headers now include deprecation
warnings about rand() usage which turn into build errors on some of the
current latest OS distros. Along with other build errors about
shared_ptr and auto_ptr which will not be able to resolve easily without
full C++11 requirement anyway.

Dear Amos,

Thanks for your feedback, I will clean the patch up some more and send it to this list again.

I can probably do the removal of xstrerror, perhaps tomorrow. (Just got back from a 10-day work trip, so my schedule is a bit unsettled at the moment.) I'm not ready to take on a full audit of all uses of errno now, though -- perhaps after I clean my patches up well enough that they can be applied, you can go ahead and audit what remains?

Thanks,
Alex Dowad

Hi,

I'm just questioning whether removing xstrerror is really desirable in cases where it is called without any intervening library function call which could overwrite errno. Amos, are you sure that's what you want to do?

I am. It's just a macro in compat/ representing "xstrerr(errno)" and as
you and others have been finding its used incorrectly often enough to
cause problems. In all the code where it was being used right
xstrerr(errno) can be used directly in its place.

References: <552E56BC.2010308@treenet.co.nz>

Message-ID: <555557A9.3080109@treenet.co.nz>

This patch is slightly different to what we have been discussing in
regard to the tls-min-version parameter values.


Overall the default behaviour is changed from enumerating the protocols
wanted. To limiting the unwanted.


* sslversion= parameter is removed from documentation.

* sslversion= code logics is converted from setting the SSL_*_method()
function to setting the ssloptions= masking parameters.

Yes this will open a hole for future libraries use of TLSv1.3. However
that is kind of desirable and if it becomes a problem the
ssloptions=NO_TLSv1_3 should be made available.


* The SSL_*_method() logic is all converted to using the flexible
SSLv23_*_method() API.

That API follows the latest specification behaviour: to send a protocol
frame type that any recipient should be able to parse (library decides
which), while only negotiating the protocol type permitted.


* A new option tls-min-version=1.N is added to server connection
directives. It controls *only* the TLS version range.

 - http(s)_port directives are not (yet) implemented using
Security::PeerOptions. For now they are left with options= masking to
select protocol support.

 - SSLv3 is left at the library default unless ssloptions=NO_SSLv3 is used.


* ssloptions= is left alone so anyone can still set the library options
masks to control SSLv3 enable/disable or specific TLS versions higher
than the configured minimum.

I agree with Amos. There are no known good reasons for that macro to
exist, and we know it has been misused.

As for predicting when errno value is preserved, doing so correctly is
nearly impossible in many cases because of C++ operators and other
implicit calls that may trigger I/O (debugging) and/or memory allocation
system calls. Any code that does not save the errno value immediately
after the system call but uses it "later" should be rewritten.


Cheers,

Alex.

Is this project alive, dead, or stuck on a wishlist somewhere?

Not that I have any interest in seeing its completion, just more user
queries about getting post-cache AV scanning to work (sigh).

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Bug 3875 MimeIcon error handling
Message-ID: <555CA6C5.9080505@treenet.co.nz>

This is an attempt to improve the MimeIcon reliability when filesystem
I/O errors or others cause the icon data to not be loadable.

The loading process is re-worked to guarantee that once the
MimeIon::created callback occurs it will result in a valid StoreEntry in
the cache representing the wanted icon.
 * If the image can be loaded without any issues it will be placed in
the cache as a 200 response.
 * If errors prevent the image being loaded or necessary parameters
(size and mtime) being known a 204 object will be placed into the cache.

I have selected 204 as the representation of errors since the bug is not
in the clients request (eliminating 400, 404, etc), a 500 would be
revealing details about server internals unnecessarily often and incur
extra complexity creating the error page. 204 also avoids needing to set
and emit Content-Length header, and just enough different from 200 to
use as a special-case test.



NP: It started with just correcting the errno usage, but other bugs
promptly started appearing once I got to seriously testing this load
process. So far it fixes:
* several assertions resulting from StoreEntry being left invalid in
cache limbo beween created hash entries and valid mem_obj data.
* on startup 6+ repeated attempts to load absent icons files which dont
exist in the filesystem.
* buffer overfow on misconfigured or corrupt mime.conf file entries
* incorrect debugs messages about file I/O errors
* large error pages delivered when icons not installed (when it doesnt
assert from the StoreEntry)

Subject: [squid-dev] Removing DNS lookups in intercept mode by using client
 dest IP address
Message-ID: <1432209622698-4671335.post@n4.nabble.com>

Hi,

I'm running squid 3.5.4 on a network which caches http and https traffic via
a tproxy redirect on a linux box. The setup runs perfectly, except that a
slight lag is introduced owing to the squid service making DNS lookups for
many of the requests it receives via http and https.

Now, I'm considering patching squid such that it auto adds the destination
IP address of the client connection to its own dns cache, for the hostname
that appears in the http header of that connection. I think this is safe
since the connection is redirected via tproxy i.e. I know that the client
machine got that IP address for the hostname in the HTTP/HTTPS request.

Assuming my logic here isn't flawed, does anyone know if this is sensible
and if any such work has already been done?

Many thanks,
John.

No, no you dont. On the contrary we do know from testing the
host_verify_strict feature that many, many clients lie.

The amount of traffic where URL and Host header contained entirely
different domain names (or even ports) was quite a surprise.

No, the DNS lookup being done is to protect against CVE-2009-0801.

That CVE is about a client browser running a malicious script provided
by a web server somewhere, which makes HTTP requests but lies when
sending the Host: header. This is trivial for an attacker to do and if
trusted would result in cache corruption affecting all clients on the
network.

Essentially if the Host header value does not match the URL or resolve
to the IP being contacted then it can't be trusted for use as a cache
key that other clients might fetch.

You could get around the DNS lookup if you really have to by patching
Squid to always mark the hostVerify as done with a failed result. But
none of the traffic would then be able to cache, so its not a very
useful thing to do.


You can probably better reduce latency by ensuring that the clients and
Squid are using the same DNS resolvers. And that they those resolvers
respond fast. That will allow Squid to verify success more often than
not and caching will raise the HIT ratio on intercepted traffic.

What IP tables rules are you using to redirect onto squid? Can you print them
here please.

hi,
  a quick googling would have brought you to

Wow, that's interesting! So it’s a very bad idea for me to have made that assumption. Thank goodness for smarter people!

Good tips. I’ll focus on improving cache performance via DNS caching.

This was applied to trunk in rev.14084 with one small addition for
OpenSSL 1.1.0 to use TLS_*_method() API which has deprecated
SSLv23_*_method() API.

Hi Nathan,

  The patch works.

However I believe It is not good idea to configure SSL_CTX objects while 
we are setting parameters to an SSL object.
A SSL_CTX object is common to many SSL objects.

Instead of setting SSL_CTX object from 
configureSSLUsingPkeyAndCertFromMemory I am suggesting a new method 
"configureUnconfigureCTX()" which does the job:

Then inside client_side use:

  bool ret = Ssl::configureSSLUsingPkeyAndCertFromMemory(...);
   if (!ret)
         debugs(33, 5, "mpla mpla");
  SSL_CTX *sslContext = SSL_get_SSL_CTX(ssl);
  ret = configureUnconfigureCTX(sslContext,..., signAlgorithm)


OR

   Ssl::configureSSL(ssl, certProperties, *port))
   SSL_CTX *sslContext = SSL_get_SSL_CTX(ssl);
   ret = configureUnconfigureCTX(sslContext,..., signAlgorithm)


Probably the above should be wrapped to a new method.
Or  maybe a new function which its name says that both CTX and SSL 
objects are modified.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Bug3329
Message-ID: <5562F5BB.2010904@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

   I am attaching new squid patches for bug3329.

The problem caused because under some circumstances the corresponding 
fde object is closed and marked as closed but the peer Comm::Connection 
object of two pinned connections is still open (Comm::Connection.fd >= 0).

The patches attached in bugzilla report are still a workaround but still 
have a major problem: The comm_close handler is not the best place to 
close a connection. The comm_close handler called because the connection 
is already closed!

To fix this problem, we must not allow Comm::Connections to get out
of sync with fd_table, even when a descriptor is closed without going
through Connection::close(). There are two ways to accomplished that:

   * Change Comm to always store Comm::Connections and similar 
high-level objects instead of fdes. This is a huge change that has been 
long on the TODO list (those "other high-level objects" is on of the 
primary obstacles there because not everything with a FD is a Connection).

   * Notify Comm::Connections about closure in their closing handler 
(this change). This design relies on every Comm::Connection having a 
close handler that notifies it. It may take us some time to reach that 
goal, but this change is the first step providing the necessary API, a 
known bug fix, and a few preventive changes.

This patch:
   - Adds a new Comm::Connection::noteClosure() method to inform the 
Comm::Connection object that somebody is closing its FD.

   - Uses the new method inside 
ConnStateData::clientPinnedConnectionClosed handler to inform the 
ConnStateData::pinning::serverConnection object that its FD is being closed.

   - Replaces comm_close calls which may cause bug #3329 in other places 
with Comm::Connection->close() calls.

Initially based on Nathan Hoad research for bug 3329.
This is a Measurement Factory project.

Regards,
      Christos

+1 on the conversion of comm_close() to X->close()

However please name the noteClsure() as noteClosureXXX() to highlight
that this function is undesirable and we need to fix the underlying
problem still for the places which find themselves having to use it.

The suggestion of this patch is to start use the noteClosure method to 
all comm_close handlers to avoid such problems.

The problem is not appears only when the comm_close method on fds is 
used. We may face the same problem when a timeout is expired but not a 
timeout-handler is installed for the fd. In this case squid code will 
just close the fd. Still some Comm::Connection objects may use the fd, 
but not informed about the fd closure.

A better long term way would be the comm FD opening code to install the
first close callback that hold reference to the Comm::Connection and
sets the FD to -1 when its closed without close().

We cant do that until those "abandoned" and "orphan" connections are all
figured out though. So we dont end up with that close handler being a
lingering reference-count that holds all the state alive.

So I agree this method is needed right now, but only as a temporary fix.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] support custom OIDs in *_cert ACLs
Message-ID: <55643638.3070006@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

This patch allow user_cert and ca_cert ACLs to match arbitrary 
stand-alone OIDs (not DN/C/O/CN/L/ST objects or their substrings). For 
example, should be able to match certificates that have 
1.3.6.1.4.1.1814.3.1.14 OID in the certificate Subject or Issuer field. 
Squid configuration would look like this:

  acl User_Cert-TrustedCustomerNum user_cert 1.3.6.1.4.1.1814.3.1.14 1001

+1 anyway.

Dont like the extra leak-ish part though. Does TidyPointer make sense there?

No.
It is not a memory leak.
The OBJ_create just adds the OID in internal openSSL database of valid 
fields.  Even if the OID is not used after a reconfigure, still remains 
in this database. This is not a real problem unless someone add some 
thousands of these OIDs.
But I do not believe that this is a real problem...

Ah, okay. No problem then. This can go in whenever you wish.

If it is OK, I will post the squid-3.5 patch to.

Hi Amos,

    Adding XXX to function names is only useful when an XXX marks a
problem in the callers code. In this case, the problem is not in the
caller at all! There is no point in bringing readers attention to the
surrounding call code. Moreover, we should enforce noteClosure() usage
in relevant callbacks, not discourage it!

Is there a bigger problem here? Yes, as the proposed commit message
documents. However, adding an XXX to this method name will not help us
avoid that bigger problem or solve it.

If you insist on naming the new method noteClosureXXX(), I am not going
to spend more cycles arguing against it, but if you are OK with the
proposed noteClosure() going in, let's commit "as is".


HTH,

Alex.
