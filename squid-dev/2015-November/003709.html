Hello Sebastian, and very welcome.

It is great to have more eyes on the TLS/SSL related code. Particularly
for the helpers you wish to focus on.

Please feel free to post any questions on the dev mailing list. Or if
you need quicker feedback, some of us try to hang out on IRC Freenode in
the #squiddev channel.

If you were not aware of it already,
&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/DeveloperResources">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/DeveloperResources</A>&gt; contains links to most
of the Squid Projects developer information. Particular ones of note are
the coding guidelines and merge procedure (when you have a patch to go in).

Amongst the existing team, Christos seems to have the best handle on how
OpenSSL works and is the main developer authoring a lot of the current
SSL code. Alex and myself are playing catchup on his work while also
doing audit and design oversight-like activity. I am also attempting a
project to generalize the code for non-OpenSSL library support, which
will sometimes affect the code you are dealing with.


Wecome to the dev team.

Amos Jeffries
