Two people sharing the same build directory? Even if we assume this is
an important use case, it does not seem to be relevant here -- the
current .bzrignore results in hundreds of files reported as unknown. A
small change in that very long list will not be noticeable today.
Perhaps I misunderstood the use case you are describing.


&gt;<i> It can also hide makefile mistakes between $srcdir and $builddir or the
</I>&gt;<i> matching top_* variables if the developer changing the makefile is
</I>&gt;<i> working in-tree.
</I>
Or it can show those mistakes.


&gt;<i> PS. I found Henriks advice years ago never to use in-tree builds to be a
</I>&gt;<i> good rule to work by and never looked back. These files are not a
</I>&gt;<i> problem when working out-or-tree, all we see in &quot;bzr status&quot; is the top
</I>&gt;<i> build directory.
</I>
Sure, but including more files into .bzrignore does not hurt those who
need to work out-of-tree.


So what is the current policy of adding X into .bzrignore?


Alex.
