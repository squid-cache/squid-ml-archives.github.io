Your call.

Given the current poor state of v3.5 and v4, I doubt trunk will receive
significant testing if you start committing major &quot;sponsored additions&quot;
there: We have more than enough technical debt in v3.5 and v4 to keep us
busy for a while, with no working regression testing setup. If major
changes start appearing in trunk, then I would have to stop recommending
running trunk for getting access to the state-of-the-art features like I
normally do.

Instead, we would be forced to add those state-of-the-art features and
fixes to a v4-based branch from where they will eventually trickle to
trunk, with even more delays and overhead than today. Thus, I recommend
against branching v4 and for committing &quot;sponsored additions&quot; with high
regressions risk to [sponsor-dedicated] branches [for testing by
sponsors and other interested parties] until we have a decent regression
testing in place.

My recommendation would have been different if we had not wasted so much
time on regressions recently and if we had a working regression testing
setup today. FWIW, I am renewing my efforts to launch that project and
hope to post the second proposal for the Board by the end of this week.


Cheers,

Alex.
