Hi,

&quot;Amos Jeffries&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-dev">squid3 at treenet.co.nz</A>&gt; writes:

&gt;<i> This patch appears to make Squid ignore loading keytabs entirely and
</I>&gt;<i> just allow random credentials from unspecified location(s) to be used.
</I>
That's correct and that's the whole point of the diff. (&quot;unspecified location&quot;... to squid)

&gt;<i> In the absence of a location from which to load the credentials where
</I>&gt;<i> does GSSAPI load the credentials from?
</I>
When a user is logged in and authenticated to a kdc, a credentials cache is kept around (in practice in a file belonging to the user in /tmp on Unix) and used whenever kerberos authentication is required by a client. That's what you see when you type &quot;klist&quot; for example. Given that one of the interesting features of kerberos is single sign on, I would be surprised that the behaviour is not very similar on other OSes/implementations.

&gt;<i> Is the users generic cache backed by a keytab somewhere in the local
</I>&gt;<i> account? and why can't we just load that?
</I>
I'm not familiar enough with kerberos to be authoritative, but I'm quite sure it's not the case : the ticket granting ticket is provided in exchange for the user's password, not thanks to a user-specific keytab AFAIK.

&gt;<i> Overall this seems to me to be making Squid pick a random user account
</I>&gt;<i> from the machine and sending a lot of traffic through some peer
</I>&gt;<i> pretending to be that user instead of a proxy. That is bad security, and
</I>&gt;<i> Kerberos is supposed to be the most secure authentication possible. So I
</I>&gt;<i> am not happy with this (yet).
</I>
I'm fine with your opinion, but you should replace &quot;a random user account&quot; by &quot;the account which started squid&quot;.

&gt;<i> NP: don't worry about small diff. We are in feature freeze for Squid-4
</I>&gt;<i> beta cycle. Since this is a small UI change it will be held anyway until
</I>&gt;<i> Squid-5 branching, which is likely to be a month or two away.
</I>
OK, I'll keep that in mind. So we can devise a better way of specifying the option. Moreover, I also realised that keeping the ability to specify a principal name in the NOKEYTAB case is pointless (and will be ignored by the current code) so if others prefer to keep a similar syntax (I'm not fond of it either), it could be login=NEGOTIATE:NOKEYTAB directly and not login=NEGOTIATE::NOKEYTAB.

Best regards,
 Aymeric
