That's what you see when you type &quot;klist&quot; for example. Given that one of the interesting features of kerberos is single sign on, I would be surprised that the behaviour is not very similar on other OSes/implementations.

</I>
I'm not sure even that is true. Because Squid dynamically alters its
user account for the workers. They may be running as some other
effective user with a different credentials cache.

Which reminds me that Squid usually cannot be started by a non-root user
anyway. There are root privileges required to do effective-user changes,
capabilities assignment, access kernel NAT tables and some other socket
operations we do.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NP: don't worry about small diff. We are in feature freeze for Squid-4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beta cycle. Since this is a small UI change it will be held anyway until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Squid-5 branching, which is likely to be a month or two away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll keep that in mind. So we can devise a better way of specifying the option. Moreover, I also realised that keeping the ability to specify a principal name in the NOKEYTAB case is pointless (and will be ignored by the current code) so if others prefer to keep a similar syntax (I'm not fond of it either), it could be login=NEGOTIATE:NOKEYTAB directly and not login=NEGOTIATE::NOKEYTAB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
 &quot;login=NEGOTIATE auth-no-keytab&quot; should do.

Like I mentioned that allows a simple boolean flag in the CachePeer.
Which avoids the macro define. And also adjusting the if conditions in
all the places auth type is detected by those nasty strcmp/strncmp tests.
