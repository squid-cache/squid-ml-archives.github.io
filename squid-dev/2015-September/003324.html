My experience has been much the same. My 'take away' though is very
different: at last we are *keeping up* with the bug reports. :-) Thank You!

Normal for this time of year would be way behind and starting the branch
notice with bug triage lists. Right now we are about even on the
reported vs fixed in bugzilla. With _none_ needing triage :-)

Theres always a silver lining. You just have to notice it.

Nod. I'm counting that as stability for existing feature though. So it
can happen any time over the betas. Earlier would be better of course.

If they dont affect UI, no problem there.

If they do I would like a rough ballpark ETA on at least when they can
start audit.


&gt;&gt;<i> My list to kick things off is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Parser-NG ICAP conversions - ETA now
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, I had no time to look at it, but hope to do that within two-three
</I>&gt;<i> days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you. It is one with no UI relevance, so take your time. It can be
in a later beta.
