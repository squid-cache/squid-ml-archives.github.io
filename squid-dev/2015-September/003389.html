Thank you for your fast reply.

&gt;<i> You are adding a new ClientHttpRequest in_size field dedicated to

</I>&gt;<i> AccessLogEntry's http.clientRequestSz.payloadData for similar purposes
</I>&gt;<i> in non-tunnel areas of the code. Would it be possible to teach tunnel.cc
</I>&gt;<i> code to update http.clientRequestSz.payloadData (directly or indirectly)
</I>&gt;<i> instead of adding a new field?
</I>
Here is a quick patch doing what you suggest. However:

- it doesn't match what happens in client_side.cc where log data gets
  filled in after the fact (see most notably req_sz field) but this may
  need fixing too after all
- it currently requires a cast because tunnelStart() expects (signed)
  int64_t's whereas payloadData is (unsigned) uint64_t, and switching to
  uint64_t everywhere requires an audit because out.size gets compared
  to some other signed quantity (expectedLength) in at least one place.
  This pulls strings in many places where int64_t's are used for size
  quantities.

  The cast is harmless because this integer gets only added to, but it's
  still a cast

If you are not satisfied with any of the two patches, please tell me
which direction you prefer and I can work on a more extensive patch
tomorrow. IMHO the advantage of the first patch is its blending with the
current code, while other nicer solutions will require changing a few
types here and there, which could be done as a second, wider, cleaning
step.

Best regards,
 Aymeric
