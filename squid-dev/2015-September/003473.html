ICAP is an adaptation protocol that almost everybody uses for access control.

The ICAP server must be able to see all traffic going through Squid so that it can do what it was designed for and block (parts) of websites and other data streams.
Other data streams may not be HTTP(S)-based and hence are not bumped, but for the ICAP server to be able to do its thing, it still needs a (fake) CONNECT.

Going back to Steve's original message, I think that it is not necessary to generate a (fake) CONNECT for each bump step,
but to send exactly one CONNECT at the moment that Squid makes a decision.  I.e. when Squid decides to bump or splice.
