You are correct:

* The ICAP client implementation in Squid does not block the whole Squid
process because communication is done using non-blocking socket I/O.
What happens on the other side of that ICAP connection depends on the
ICAP server implementation. Some ICAP servers never create threads, some
create a thread per transaction, some support a pool of threads, and
some let ICAP adapters decide how to handle each transaction.

* The eCAP client (a.k.a. &quot;host&quot;) implementation has to block the whole
host process because it has to use regular C++ function calls. What
happens on the other side of that function call is the eCAP adapter
responsibility. If your adapter can return from all eCAP function calls
&quot;fast&quot;, there is no need to worry (and you are saving a lot by not
having to go over a TCP connection). If you cannot answer some of the
host questions &quot;immediately&quot;, then you have to implement an async eCAP
adapter that uses threads or other non-blocking mechanisms to shield the
host application from &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;blocking&quot; adapter code.


Cheers,

Alex.
