Well it is complex but for now I intend to to implement only REQMOD and 
to implement two or three things which will not touch the body.
I cut it down to only two cases which in any case will not touch the 
body for now.
I do also think that the best way is to use some kind of 30X redirection 
instead of altering the request leaving aside that it simplifies things 
for me.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Does squid expect me to change the URI only in the request first line or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;also the Host header?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This answers the question.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;It is not a &quot;critical&quot; question since for now I replace them both, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;if squid expects only the URI in the first request line to be changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;there is no point to change the Host header.
</I>&gt;<i> See above. But you may not want to tie this behaviour to depend on
</I>&gt;<i> Squid. ICAP is by design portable between proxies and other types of
</I>&gt;<i> ICAP clients.
</I>Well you are right, but I do not see other proxies using my ICAP 
service(not being negative) and also I cannot really anticipate how they 
will act.
There are only couple cases that might appear which are mentioned in the 
RFC and clears things up.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks In Advance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Eliezer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;* I am trying to think about documenting couple things about ICAP in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;WIKI with an example ICAP service.
</I>&gt;<i> Our wiki is probably not the best place. Unless you were just
</I>&gt;<i> concentrating on the squid.conf parts, and AFAICS that is covered already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to get in contact with Christos about improving c-icap
</I>&gt;<i> documentation or the ICAP forum for adding to their docs for the service
</I>&gt;<i> internals or how-to documentation.
</I>I am not using c-icap and I will probably wont use it due to my 
preference of other languages then C and C++.
But it seems like the ICAP forum is the place to start.

Thanks,
Eliezer

* The ICAP service I wrote is far from complete but it works pretty fast 
in REQMOD for url inspection. I do want to expand it to be able to 
return StoreID but it is totally depends the squid side for now.
