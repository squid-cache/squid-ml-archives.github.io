HTTP/2 has a concept of stream &quot;window&quot; (aka I/O buffering) which has
space that shrinks and grows as data arrives and leaves. We could call
this http_stream_window_max.


&gt;<i> can't think of anything better. The patches are also abusing

Nod. MemBuf that is actually one of the existing uses elsewhere (ew).
SBuf its abnormal - which is why I said this was long term and a lot of
work. I'm not expecting you to do that.
