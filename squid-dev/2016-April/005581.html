Me too. However, please keep in mind that beyond [unlikely] compilation
failures, it would be difficult for non-developers to confirm that the
patch does not break anything, especially without somebody writing
detailed instructions on how to do that: AFAICT, the code in question
does not affect any functionality that is both enabled by default and
visible in Squid logs or responses.

FWIW, the patch did compile fine on a few Linux boxes and one MacOS laptop.


It would also be great to test whether the clang exclusion was motivated
by the same outdated (or even wrong) reasons as the other hacks around
this code -- we may be able to remove that last exclusion if those tests
are successful. Again, this will require a person who knows how to read
Valgrind reports and can test --enable-xmalloc-statistics effects.


Thank you,

Alex.
