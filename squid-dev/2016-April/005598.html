I mean algorithm, if you can name one I can look up that would be fine
and I investigate using it as opposed to search. What I've used is the
best I can think of so far.

The use-case is to process a new HTTP/2 frame arriving and associate it
to the stream. So a map might work, but would grow to perhapse 2^32
entries unless we could also find a good way to purge entries. With only
a small / limited number active at any time the search/walk should be
&quot;fast enough&quot; and is replaceable if that better algorithm appears
tomorrow or next year.

</I>
This is kind of the direction why I picked list as the type for Pipeline
to begin with. std::queue is apparently implemented as a std::list with
cutdown API in the first place.

Going with just std::list then HTTP/1.x can use it as if it were a
strict FIFO queue, while HTTP/2 can use it as a list very roughly
&quot;sorted&quot; by priority (aka. FIFO but not a strict queue access ordering).

Since the API type is a list, the Server class is made responsible for
implementing the right semantics on the pipeline. For example;
HTTP/1.x-only logics not doing a walk unless its by repeatedly
pop()'ing, etc.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the first bullet, please note HTTP/1 can internally do a
</I>&gt;<i> simple/efficient &quot;pop(void)&quot; and only then check the popped ID, even
</I>&gt;<i> though its public API can be exactly the same &quot;removeById()&quot; API used by
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP/2.
</I>
Sounds okay. I will look at adding that with version indicators in the
method docs so we can see the dual-API separation and see how that goes.

</I>
&quot;pipeline&quot; is the RFC term for the set of transactions sent/received on
a single connection, so I went with the flow. (pun intended, have a nice
day).
