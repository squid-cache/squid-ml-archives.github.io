</I>&gt;<i> dropping helper requests due to persistent overload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code had conflicting notions of an &quot;overloaded helper&quot;. The external

</I>&gt;<i> test whether the new request would overflow the queue (and, hence,

</I>&gt;<i> queue was full! It checked whether the queue was already overflowing.
</I>&gt;<i> This confusion resulted in that code scheduling one extra helper request
</I>&gt;<i> before enabling bypass. The code and its documentation are now more
</I>&gt;<i> consistent (and better match the &quot;overload&quot; terminology used by the new
</I>&gt;<i> configuration option, which also feels better than calling the helper
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;full&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (*) Resolving the above confusion resulted in minor (one request)
</I>&gt;<i> differences in the number of helper requests queued by Squid for
</I>&gt;<i> external ACL, URL rewriting, and store ID helpers, with the adjusted
</I>&gt;<i> behavior [better] matching the documentation.

Thank you

in src/cf.data.pre:

* s/temporary exceed/temporarily exceed/

* For things like:
  &quot;on-persistent-overload option, described below, applies&quot;

 - please remove the above/below wording. The online config
documentation uses separate pages for options, and the config generator
can re-order directives sometimes. There is no dependable above/below to
refer to.
 - above/below occurs several times in the new texts.


* the lines documenting 'die' and 'err' action look a bit squashed up.
Please:
 - move &quot;Two actions are supported:&quot; to the start of a new line
 - empty lines for clarity on listed entries.
 - use 2 space indent on the action.
 - tab indent all the description lines to make sure that all lines
align on their left side.
 - remove the colons, that avoids anyone being confused about whether
they are part of the options name.

It should look like this:

&quot;
	.....

	Two on-persistent-overload actions are supported:

	  die	...

	  err	...
		...
&quot;



in src/helper.cc

* &quot;whether at least one more request can be successfully submitted&quot;
 - looks wrong documentation for the overloaded() method.
 - the true output happens when the queue *is* past full, not when one
more requests can be added.

* why is helper::SubmissionFailure() a member of helper?
 - it does not use any of *this class members.
 - you could make it a templated local static function:
 template&lt;class Type&gt; static void
 SubmissionFailure(const Type hlp, ...

* helper::SubmissionFailure is also changing what was previously
Helper::Unknown result codes to Helper::Error.
 - Helper::Error is one of the helper output codes, it means success.
Obviousy when hlp == NULL, there is no success going on.
 - please revert to sending helper::Unknown code.



Aso, can we please add a &quot;wait&quot; action as well. Which means just keep
queueing things and ignore the overload.


Cheers
Amos
