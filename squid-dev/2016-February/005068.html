I have not seen what you have committed (too busy dealing with trunk
bugs and other issues), but, FWIW, based on past experience, there may
be a fundamental disagreement regarding what constitutes no-logic
changes. For example, creating new classes and moving old classes into
new namespaces is often _not_ a no-logic change. In fact, it is one of
the most difficult-to-get-right changes! Whether the compiled code is
about the same after the change is irrelevant.

Again, I am _not_ saying you have just committed something you should
not have. I am only saying that our definitions probably differ. How to
deal with that is your call. Right now, I cannot offer any practical
solution to resolve those differences or protect us from their bad side
effects.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>
I am sure I can create a solution, but I was hoping to avoid doing that.
I can start by suggesting that if what you are saying is true, then you
probably need to either

* configure Pipeline to use one of the two different storage structures
with the same API (optimal but often more difficult to design right) or

* always use one Pipeline storage structure with two indices (worse
performance, more RAM, and messier code but possibly easier to shovel
into Squid).

For the first bullet, please note HTTP/1 can internally do a
simple/efficient &quot;pop(void)&quot; and only then check the popped ID, even
though its public API can be exactly the same &quot;removeById()&quot; API used by
HTTP/2.

BTW, &quot;Pipeline&quot; does not sound like the right name for a class managing
mostly independent components each of which can be removed at any time
without significant effect on others (as is the case with HTTP/2 streams).


HTH,

Alex.
