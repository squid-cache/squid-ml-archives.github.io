<PRE>Sorry for not geting to this a long time back. It seems to have got lost
behind the xmas/holiday email backlog.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Patch description:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many web servers do not have complete certificate chains. Many browsers
</I>&gt;<i> use certificate extensions of the server certificate and download the
</I>&gt;<i> missing intermediate certificates automatically from the Internet. This
</I>&gt;<i> patch add this feature to Squid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The information for missing issuer certificates provided by the
</I>&gt;<i> Authority  Information Access X509 extension. This describes the format
</I>&gt;<i> and location of additional information provided by the issuer of the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate in which in which this extension appears. If the caIssuers
</I>&gt;<i> access method provided then the issuer certificate information provided
</I>&gt;<i> and the access location field exist in thois extension provides the
</I>&gt;<i> location of the issuer certificate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This patch:
</I>&gt;<i>   - Implements an Downloader class as ConnStateData kid class. This new
</I>&gt;<i> class can be used by internal squid subsystems to download objects from
</I>&gt;<i> net.
</I>
Please no more ConnStateData derived classes. ::Server is the head of
that hierarchy and the servers/ classes as the per-protocol children.

And Um...

ConnStateData is a ::Server class about managing the squid end of a
client-&gt;Squid connection.

&quot;Download&quot; activity is a ::Client class type of activity, which is about
managing the Squid end of a Squid-&gt;server connection.


I am aware there is a need for the store logics to be involved. But
surely StoreEntry and/or clientStreams does not require the whole
::<i>Server 'side' of Squid to be involved.
</I>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Modify Ssl::PeerConnector class to use new Downloader class to
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve missing certificaes from the net. It retrieved the URIs of
</I>&gt;<i> missing certificates from the Authority Information Access X509 extension.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Implements a new SSL records and SSL handshake messages parser
</I>&gt;<i> (Ssl::HandshakeParser class) to improve current SSL messages parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> The new parser now used to check if a Change Cipher Spec message
</I>&gt;<i> included in server hello. The related code removed from
</I>&gt;<i> Ssl::Bio::sslFeatures class
</I>
Okay in theory. But please do this (and below?) as a separate feature to
the Downloader. They will each have a fair amount of discussion + audit
and there is no need to have this block this if the other get stuck on
some detail.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Modify the Ssl::ServerBio class to:
</I>&gt;<i>      * Buffer the Server Hello message and process it before pass it to
</I>&gt;<i> the openSSL library.
</I>&gt;<i>      * Extract server certificates from server hello message. This is
</I>&gt;<i> required to check if there are missing certificates, and if yes give the
</I>&gt;<i> chance to squid to download missing certificates and complete
</I>&gt;<i> certificate chains before pass them for processing to openSSL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Fixes and improves the Ssl::Bio related code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a Measurement Factory project
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Looking at the patch I also see you have added a thing called
BinaryTokenizer, but the Tokenizer we already have operates on binary
octets. All that seems needed is some new accessor(s) for fetching the
fixed-width binary fields alongside the current int64() ASCII-&gt;integer
decoder.
