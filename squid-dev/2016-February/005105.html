The tests you list above would be much better than nothing so thank you
for doing whatever you can.

To answer your question in the Subject line, no amount of lab testing
would clear v4.x as &quot;very stable for production&quot; -- the goal of such
testing ought to be rather different.


FWIW, I am still trying to find the time to finalize the way-overdue
Proper Squid QA plan for the Foundation Board. I am getting closer
though (and we now got more/better tools to back that plan up).


Thank you,

Alex.
