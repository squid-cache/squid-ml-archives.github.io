</I>
Because the &quot;file&quot; in its name means the data is stored to the local
filesystem in some &quot;flat-file&quot; DB format. My understanding is that redis
uses its own binary DB format.

The redis version requires a whole new library linkage, its header files
and code for its API use. As a result the two binaries will act very
differently when passed the same data. Depending solely on which backend
was chosen. With a lot of policy and security implications around those
differences.

For the squid.conf viewpoint the difference is trivial. But for the
maintenance, support, security, and distributor activities it makes a
lot of things easier to deal with two binaries.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Being able to build or omit helpers based on what the final environment

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not about building or omitting a helper AFAICT. It is about what
</I>&gt;<i> the helper does. Why not control that via a command line option, with
</I>&gt;<i> good defaults (among other things such as ./configure tests)?
</I>
It is. A generic distro builder who builds two helpers leaves the
installers with the option to actually install only one binary if the
other does not meet local policy/security requirements.

In the generic builders this is best supported by providing different
packages with different binaries inside. Which gets very annoying and/or
tricky if the difference is ./configure parameters
(--with/--without-hiredis) to produce different buinaries.

Its also about explaining to users why this &quot;file&quot; helper does not
necessarily store things to the local FS, where all the others do.
