</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TODAY:
</I>&gt;<i>  a) that C vs C++ distinction non longer exists. If the dependencies are

</I>&gt;<i> error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  b) several of the helpers are actually very tightly integrated and even

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which brings us to ..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q2: why is helpers/ separate from src/ ?
</I>&gt;<i>   should we shuffle them back to src/*/helpers/ directories on a
</I>&gt;<i> per-component basis ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1* the current configure.ac logic would as easily work for scanning
</I>&gt;<i> src/*/helpers/X as for helpers/*/X
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2* the move would simplify the bundle size by a few Makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3* the move would simplify the use of our fancy custom logic designs in
</I>&gt;<i> helpers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4* it does somewhat hinder anyone wanting to manually build a single
</I>&gt;<i> helper. Though I have not heard of anyone doing so in many years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5* it does mean we should probably discard the goal of having the helpers
</I>&gt;<i> be demo code examples for people to base their custom helpers on.
</I>
I have no objections to moving helpers/ into src/.
I see little benefits in point 2 above (I've numbered them), and few
downsides in 4, I don't think point 5 applies.
I don't think c vs. c++ makes a difference with dependencies. It's
some &quot;fancy custom logics&quot; which are not available outside helpers. I
don't however believe it'll be prevalent.

In other words, +0 from me.
