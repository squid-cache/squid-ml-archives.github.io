</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Since we are considering Downloader a type of high level protocol

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTTP-ish messages before the rest of Squid logic gets to mangle them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that showing Downloader requests at ALL,2 is a good idea,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if it is easy to report [until the routing layer supplies
</I>&gt;<i> that functionality for all routing clients]. Needless to say, that
</I>&gt;<i> reporting should be done when the request is formed, not in the class
</I>&gt;<i> destructor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Downloader::downloadFinished method
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - that comment brings up the question of whether that Must() should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confirming doneAll() instead of done() ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Must(done()) is correct. doneAll() becomes true when a _positive_
</I>&gt;<i> termination goal has been reached so when we want to assert that the job
</I>&gt;<i> is done (for any reason) we must use the more comprehensive done().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please remove the following &quot;Squid will delete...&quot; comment or replace it
</I>&gt;<i> with a more accurate one:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Must(done()); // we will be deleted upon exiting job's AsyncCall
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We should probably add an AsyncJob method that encapsulates the above
</I>&gt;<i> check _and_ verifies that the job is currently handling an async call,
</I>&gt;<i> but that improvement is outside your project scope, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - the symbol name 'callback' has a clash between the private method,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the private member Pointer. This is a case where the '_' suffix is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required to distinguish them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT, that private method is spelled callBack (appropriately making
</I>&gt;<i> the method name a verb rather than a &quot;callback&quot; noun used for the data
</I>&gt;<i> member) so there is no clash. I am not against adding the '_' suffix though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in src/ssl/PeerConnector.h:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * since certsDownloads is apparently constrained to values up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MaxCertsDownloads. Can we please use a small integer type like uint8_t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of a full 'int' ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not use uint8_t. I believe this has been discussed already:
</I>&gt;<i> Size-specific types should only be used when there is a specific correct
</I>&gt;<i> size (e.g., we must replicate a system structure) and/or we must
</I>&gt;<i> minimize memory footprint (e.g., lots of structures containing this
</I>&gt;<i> member are expected, especially inside a large container).
</I>
Or when we need some certainty about what the size of the data field
actually is.

Side track: For sizes of payload objects we should be centering on
uint64_t to handle the large objects instead of size_t or int which
can't handle them.

This situation is ambiguous for Downloader though since its
HTTP_REQBUF_SZ can only able to handle 4 KB or smaller objects.

I would like that increased to 64KB though. Since we have already had
sightings of quite large certificates coming out of Google with lots of
alternative-domain entries in the cert.


Anyhow back to MaxCertsDownloads...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using &quot;int&quot; is the correct default because it does not force the reader
</I>&gt;<i> to pause and think &quot;Why 8 bits?&quot;,
</I>
Not having a fixed size forces the reader to stop and think &quot;what can
int be?&quot; then investgate all the code to find out what parts are using
int to mean something other than 32-bit signed values.

Note that Squid is used on some embeded systems where int != 32-bit.


&gt;<i> is usually faster, will be printed as
</I>&gt;<i> a number on std::ostream (rather than a character), and has fewer
</I>&gt;<i> chances to accidentally overflow when somebody decides to increase
</I>&gt;<i> MaxCertsDownloads (e.g., by making it configurable) without updating
</I>&gt;<i> certsDownloads.
</I>
The person doing that needs to know the value ranges they are changing
and what side effects the change will have. Using &quot;int&quot; just obscures
the issues.
