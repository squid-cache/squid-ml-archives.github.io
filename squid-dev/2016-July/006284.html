<PRE>I want to understand the way a WebSocket Splice would work.

The issue:

Clients are issuing secured connections which contains WebSockets internally
and squid HTTP parsing breaks these connections.

&gt;<i>From a security aspect of things, many companies would not like the idea of
</I>the options to &quot;smuggle&quot; data using http through a proxy.

 

Another related issue which deserves attention:

Certificate pinning and connection breakage.

Currently we cannot determine for many connections what is the &quot;issue&quot;, is
it the bumping itself of the breakage of a WebSocket http connection.

 

An acceptable solution:

Alex mentioned the option to splice a bumped connection.

 

I do not know exactly what Alex meant since not much details were presented.

How complex would it be to add an option to &quot;splice&quot;(maybe already done) a
bumped http connection?
For WebSockets to be supported we just need to dump the request headers into
the wire and &quot;splice&quot; everything back.

I was thinking about maybe adding if not there already a &quot;Connection: close&quot;
to try and verify that in some level the connection would be closed properly
by a civil server.

It's not &quot;Secure&quot; for many places but I think it could be pretty straight
forward to workaround this administrative issue.

I assume that the same solution can be applied to both regular
sockets\connections and secured.

 

As I understand, it would not be possible  to do this kind of splice without
bumping first.

 

Another related subject is CONNECT based TCP connections smuggling.

The scenario is that a client tries to issue a TCP connection using a
CONNECT method while these can be a wrapped HTTP ones.

 

I only would like to get feedback to make sure that my understanding of the
complexity of the subject is in the right direction.

 

Thanks,

Eliezer
