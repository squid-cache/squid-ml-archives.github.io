This change is not meant to affect public keys.

</I>
I believe the comment is correct because private keys are not shared
among kids. Being unknown to others is the essence of being a private
key. The only entities that are supposed to know about a private key is
the entity holding the corresponding StoreEntry lock. One cannot find a
StoreEntry with a private key in Store.

If you know of any exceptions to that rule, please let me know.


&gt;<i> That would make them required for proper operations in SMP.
</I>
Caching (SMP-aware and not) should be done using public, not private keys.

It may help to look at this bug from a different angle: After we stopped
zeroing memory and before this fix, all private keys were essentially
random values -- calling private key generation function with the same
set of arguments would produce a different value. And yet, everything
&quot;worked&quot; because private keys are compatible with random values by their
nature/definition. The fix takes advantage of that understanding to
simplify and optimize private key generation.


HTH,

Alex.
