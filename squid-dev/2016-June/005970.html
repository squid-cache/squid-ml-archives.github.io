Disclaimer: I have not read the Vary discussion on squid-users. I
suspect your RFC is generic enough to ignore that discussion as far as
the RFC is concerned.

I assume that by &quot;finally add&quot; you meant something like &quot;finally implement&quot;.

Sounds good.


&gt;<i> And using the

</I>
I am not sure exactly what you mean, but which headers/transactions to
mangle should be up to the Squid admin. The pre- and post-cache mangling
will often differ. The pre- and post-cache mangling API will be very
similar, of course, but we should not restrict the admin to a single set
of rules that is always applied on both sides of the cache.

One elegant way to implement this would be to add a vectoring-point ACL
that will match &quot;pre-cache&quot; and &quot;post-cache&quot; vectoring points (at
least). That way, you do not need to add new directives but admins can
mangle headers differently on each side. I suspect these ACLs would be
useful in other contexts as well.


As for &quot;eCAP versus squid.conf&quot; mangling, I suggest the following rules
of thumb:

0. Message body mangling belongs to eCAP/ICAP.

1. If header mangling decisions require information contained in the
message body, such mangling belongs to eCAP/ICAP.

2. Header field mangling that cannot be expressed using &quot;add field&quot;,
&quot;delete field&quot;, or &quot;a regex substitution of the field value&quot; operation
belongs to eCAP/ICAP.

3. All other mangling actions can be supported directly in squid.conf,
at any vectoring point.


Thank you,

Alex.
