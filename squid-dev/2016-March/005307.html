That part is already implemented in Christos patch and does not need
fixing AFAICT: userDataDone and waitingForOrigin are indeed somewhat
similar to reading/writing states in ConnStateData. The situation is
more complex in FTP code because the states are not as universal as
reading and writing -- the states and their correct interpretation
depends on the FTP command being processed. My dissatisfaction was not
with this mechanism though.

My comment was about how we react to [one of] the &quot;stop&quot; event[s]. My
alternative sketch was bad though because I misunderstood what exactly
Christos was trying to accomplish. The comments on this thread helped me
arrive at the [hopefully] final suggestion that I just posted in
response to his take3 patch.


&gt;<i> * readTransferDoneReply() its not clear what the moved debugs() is saying

</I>&gt;<i>  - is it finished one object send/receive on a data channel that had (or

</I>&gt;<i>  - is the new location of the debugs still agnostic to up/down direction

</I>
I think it is #1 and #3. The Ftp::Relay code does not reuse data
connections IIRC -- dataComplete() is called after each data transfer. I
am not even sure FTP allows for data connection reuse (but that
discussion is outside this thread scope).

I do not see a much better way to phrase that debugs(), and we should
not demand a change to the old debugs() line that was simply moved to
the [only] caller (AFAICT). Said that, if I were to polish this, I would
merge the moved debugs() with the status-only debugs() already present
in the beginning of this method:

 void
 Ftp::Relay::readTransferDoneReply()
 {
    debugs(9, 2, &quot;origin confirmed download/upload end with FTP &quot; &lt;&lt;
status());
    ...


s/confirmed/signaled/ if you prefer.


Thank you,

Alex.
