Forgive me if I missed how this decision was made earlier, but I do not
understand why we want to duplicate the existing memAllocString()-like
functionality and split a single set of raw memory pools shared by all
callers into two isolated sets?

In other words, how did we get from &quot;SIGSEGV in memFreeString&quot; (i.e.,
bug 4438) to this? If your working (or perhaps already proven!) theory
is that memAllocString() does something wrong, why not fix
memAllocString() instead of duplicating it? I must be missing something
obvious here...


&gt;<i> Known side-effects:

</I>
Why is that a side effect? Could we not &quot;tune memblob sizes according to
actual use patterns&quot; before this change?

Or do you meant that we can tune two separate sets of pools now? If yes,
then you should also list &quot;two separate sets of pools instead of one
shared by all callers&quot; as a side effect -- &quot;more isolated sets&quot; is the
&quot;cost&quot; associated with this ability to tune more sets...


&gt;<i> - as no MemBlob can be initialized before MemPools, there is no need
</I>&gt;<i> to baloon statically-initialized MemBlobs to
</I>&gt;<i> SmallestStringBeforeMemIsInitialized.
</I>
If your change guarantees that no MemBlob can be initialized before
MemPools, why cannot a similar change be done to the original code so
that no memAllocString()/etc. caller can get its result before MemPools
are initialized? AFAICT, you have solved the problem that you were
trying to solve, but I do not understand why you had to solve it in a
new location (leaving the old problem unsolved?).


Thank you,

Alex.
