It is an attempt to sidestep initialization issues by having pools in
the same translation unit as their user.
The other effects are IMO generally beneficial but are not the main goal.

&gt;<i> In other words, how did we get from &quot;SIGSEGV in memFreeString&quot; (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> bug 4438) to this? If your working (or perhaps already proven!) theory

</I>&gt;<i> memAllocString() instead of duplicating it? I must be missing something
</I>&gt;<i> obvious here...
</I>
Unfortunately we can't prove what is doing what wrong as we (or at
least I) can't reproduce the bug.

&gt;&gt;<i> Known side-effects:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - allows to tune memblob sizes according to actual use patterns, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be collected via SBuf/MemBlob detailed stats. The currently-set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sizes follow some light testing I've done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that a side effect? Could we not &quot;tune memblob sizes according to
</I>&gt;<i> actual use patterns&quot; before this change?
</I>
We do not know the useage patterns of all memAllocString callers; we
do know those of MemBlob via SBufDetailedStats. As an alternative
approach for this kind of optimization, we could instrument
memAllocString to gather that data as well.

&gt;<i> Or do you meant that we can tune two separate sets of pools now? If yes,
</I>&gt;<i> then you should also list &quot;two separate sets of pools instead of one
</I>&gt;<i> shared by all callers&quot; as a side effect -- &quot;more isolated sets&quot; is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cost&quot; associated with this ability to tune more sets...
</I>
Nod.

&gt;&gt;<i> - as no MemBlob can be initialized before MemPools, there is no need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to baloon statically-initialized MemBlobs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SmallestStringBeforeMemIsInitialized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your change guarantees that no MemBlob can be initialized before
</I>&gt;<i> MemPools, why cannot a similar change be done to the original code so
</I>&gt;<i> that no memAllocString()/etc. caller can get its result before MemPools
</I>&gt;<i> are initialized? AFAICT, you have solved the problem that you were
</I>&gt;<i> trying to solve, but I do not understand why you had to solve it in a
</I>&gt;<i> new location (leaving the old problem unsolved?).
</I>
I do not yet know if I have solved the problem, unfortunately.
If this attempt is successful, it can be a blueprint for modernizing
memAllocString, or splitting other callers altogether. The file name
(old_api) is to me an indicator that these API are not really
encouraged, and on the way to deprecation if not deprecated already.

Thanks
