This is what fast-sni does! For the step1-to-step2 does not involved any 
openSSL code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would solve several problems we have currently:
</I>&gt;<i> * less explicit configurations of step1 actions leading to these problem

</I>&gt;<i> * almost all users having to explicitly configure peek at step 1 to get

</I>&gt;<i> * having to hack up careful http_access configs to deal with the raw-IP
</I>&gt;<i> CONNECT that we start with. Instead jumping straight to the fake-CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> with SNI details, or raw-IP meaning no SNI.
</I>&gt;<i>   - in other words the CONNECT filters by dstdomain can work without
</I>&gt;<i> having to start ssl_bump.
</I>&gt;<i> * logging and routing of the CONNECT much more consistently being based
</I>&gt;<i> on a domain or server name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both peek and stare then reliably mean operations only on the
</I>&gt;<i> serverHello, and Squid can probably start to warn about config issues a
</I>&gt;<i> bit better.
</I>
I think, already peek, stare on step1 does not make any difference.
The stare or peek decision is a decision for step2.

But I am not sure that we can completely remove the step1. Splice on 
step1 required for non SSL related protocols.
