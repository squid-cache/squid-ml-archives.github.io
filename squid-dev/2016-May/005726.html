* the existing code causes problems and violates C++ rules
* the fix does not have known problems
* the fix has been tested on several platforms
* nobody has committed to report results for untested platforms
* the Squid Project provides no access to those untested platforms
* testing this code is difficult so the set of volunteers is tiny

Given the above, I suggest to apply polished changes to trunk and see
what happens on those untested and hard-to-get-to platforms. Any
objections or better ideas?


Thank you,

Alex.
