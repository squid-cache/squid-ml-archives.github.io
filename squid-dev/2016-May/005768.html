IIRC you would be referring to the malloc block header. Which our pools
allocator does not have. Figures.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, in trunk r14100 case, sizeof(*buf) means sizeof(char) which is 1.

I dont recall unfortunately. Not many, if any.

Right now grep shows uses of &quot;sizeof(*&quot; in total for 3.5 at 149, and
trunk at 148. I'll start reviewing them all shortly.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  sizeof(buf) is the 32-bit/64-bit size of pointers in the build. So we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't use that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We could hard-code the 4KB size here for 3.5. But I'd rather learn what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend using an array for v3.5:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     char buf[4096];
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A fixed-size array is simple, fast, exception-safe, does not need
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic allocation/cleanup, and allows you to use sizeof(buf) instead of
</I>&gt;<i> repeating 4096 or naming that constant. 4KB stack objects are fine in
</I>&gt;<i> non-recursive, non-kernel contexts. A C array is less safe than
</I>&gt;<i> std::array, but we can leave with that risk in this context.
</I>
I already reverted it to the original &quot;4096&quot; constant that was there
previously before receiving this.

Not sure this is important enough to warrant a second change just for
the remainder of 3.5 lifetime. If you disagree feel free to apply a
commit to 3.5 branch for that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know why you have chosen the complex route of dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> allocating a 4KiB buffer. Perhaps you were trying to avoid writing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;4096&quot;? There is no shame in writing that, as long as you write it only
</I>&gt;<i> once for each distinct purpose.
</I>
Not sure why you are using the word &quot;you&quot; there. I'm only responsible
for the sizeof().

Its current form as a local scope buffer with dynamic allocation was
begun in rev.2394 by yourself with its data being copied/appended into
StoreEntry. It appears that you did so as a way to keep things
consistent around the experiments #if construct, but later removal of
that &quot;#if 0&quot; dead code did not touch the code left behind.

AFAIK, Duane's rev.1575 had used a dynamic allocation earlier because
Squid was generating the entire response message, headers and body alike
in a &quot;buf = get_free_4k_page();&quot; allocation and passing it wholesale to
the comm_write equivalent of the day.
