Well the STL docs says GCC 4.9, but there are problems on that version
too. I think GCC 5 is going to be the minimum for Squid-5.

Which is the reason why this regex change was delayed until squid-5.

If you want to look at legality;

Part of the LTS contract is that software feature changes are *not*
done. The clients have chosen to make that a requirement. The OS
distributors have chosen to meet it. Nothing to do with what Squid
Project does in our latest shiny version.

It is actually a bit unreasonable to ask us not to add new features to
the upstream code to prevent breakage in something that was designed
specifically NOT to run those new software versions.

So, if anything it is more likely to be &quot;illegal&quot; to run Squid-5 on
those OS.


Despite the unreasonableness I'm procrastinating as much as I can to
balance the overlap of timelines. But I also have to look at the
projected timing of stable releases. If I stretch it much longer we are
going to have a whole pile of 5-year LTS releases through to 2027
suffering from v3.5 bugs that are already fixed by v4.

</I>
That type of service which IMO can and should be paid for. Even with
open source the &quot;free&quot; only stretches so far. Customers have money,
payment is what makes them &quot;customers&quot;.

On the other side, v4 is still in beta so if there is a strong need you
can probably still twist my arm into accepting things there. NO big
things though please as it does need to get stable ASAP. And as usual
TLS/SSL stuff is going back as requested, no twisting needed.
