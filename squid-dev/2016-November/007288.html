The patch does not add two major features. It only adds one regular feature.


&gt;<i> The logic changes adding support for access controls 'kind' other than
</I>&gt;<i> allow/deny should be proposed as a separate feature addition.
</I>
Squid already supports many actions other than allow/deny. AFAIK, the
proposed patch reduces code duplication in that existing code area while
reusing the already working approach. No logic changes related to
non-allow/deny actions are being proposed here. While splitting the code
improvements from the new feature may be possible, their coexistence
certainly does not warrant a -1 vote!


&gt;<i> Secondly;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO the access control for schemes is implemented wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the past 10 years admin who have been requesting control over what
</I>&gt;<i> schemes get advertised to clients have been driven by two main use cases:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  1) segmented networks where auth is done differently on each segment
</I>&gt;<i> (ie WAN vs LAN) but all segments share the one proxy.
</I>&gt;<i>  - either access controls to prevent some scheme being advertised to one
</I>&gt;<i> segment,
</I>&gt;<i>  - or being able to use one scheme name in several different ways
</I>&gt;<i> (different helper or realm etc.) .
</I>

Or being able to control the order of schemes presented to the user.


&gt;<i> To resolve (1) fully we will need to have multiple Config objects with
</I>&gt;<i> the same scheme name and different config details.
</I>
The use cases covered by the proposed patch do not need different
configurations for the same scheme. The proposed changes do not preclude
such future support. Moreover, such future support will not address some
of the use cases covered by the proposed patch. In other words, what has
been implemented and your suggestion are complementary, not mutually
exclusive.


&gt;<i> To add auth scheme access controls in a way that does not actively
</I>&gt;<i> prevent (1) from being implemented later IMO we need to add access
</I>&gt;<i> controls as a member of the Config object, *not* as a global access list.
</I>
Per-scheme access controls do not work for controlling the order of the
presented schemes. The order is currently hard-coded. The proposed patch
makes it configurable. Future patches may certainly add per scheme
access controls and other knobs as needed. I see no reason why the two
complementary mechanisms cannot coexist.

Also, while working on the proposed feature, we have discovered why
adding per-scheme ACLs (or a special NONE value to auth_schemes) will
create a negative side effect that the posted implementation avoids: The
implemented code does not change authentication decision; auth_schemes
cannot accidentally create a situation where no schemes exist for a
transaction. Interpreting such a situation correctly is going to be
tricky: Does it mean &quot;allow access without authentication&quot; or &quot;deny
access&quot;? Or should Squid keep evaluating other http_access rules because
the decision/ACLs may change later?

This &quot;NONE&quot; problem does not imply that multiple same-scheme
configurations are a bad idea, of course. It only illustrates why the
&quot;Should I use this configuration for scheme X?&quot; and &quot;What schemes should
I use for this transaction?&quot; are two different questions, each deserving
an answer in various real-world situations.

Please reconsider your initial evaluation.


Thank you,

Alex.
