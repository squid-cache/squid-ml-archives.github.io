Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Incorrect logging of request size
Message-ID: <57C8A127.7040604@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch fixes logged request size (%http::>st) and other size-related
%codes.

The %[http::]>st logformat code should log the actual number of
[dechunked] bytes received from the client. However, for requests with
Content-Length, Squid was logging the sum of the request header size and
the Content-Length header field value instead. The logged value was
wrong when the client sent fewer than Content-Length body bytes.

Also:

* Fixed %http::>h and %http::<h format codes for icap_log. The old code
   was focusing on preserving the "request header" (i.e. not "response
   header") meaning of the %http::>h logformat code, but since ICAP
   services deal with (and log) both HTTP requests and responses, that
   focus on the HTTP message kind actually complicates ICAP logging
   configuration and will eventually require introduction of new %http
   logformat codes that would be meaningless in access.log context.

   - In ICAP context, %http::>h should log to-be-adapted HTTP message
     headers embedded in an ICAP request (HTTP request headers in REQMOD;
     HTTP response headers in RESPMOD). Before this change, %http::>h
     logged constant/"FYI" HTTP request headers in RESPMOD.

   - Similarly, %http::<h should log adapted HTTP message headers
     embedded in an ICAP response (HTTP request headers in regular
     REQMOD; HTTP response headers in RESPMOD and during request
     satisfaction in REQMOD). Before this change, %http::<h logged "-" in
     REQMOD.

   In other words, in ICAP logging context, the ">" and "<" characters
   should indicate ICAP message kind (where the being-logged HTTP message
   is embedded), not HTTP message kind, even for %http codes.

   TODO: %http::>h code logs "-" in RESPMOD because AccessLogEntry does
   not store virgin HTTP response headers.

* Correctly initialize ICAP ALE HTTP fields related to HTTP message
   sizes for icap_log, including %http::>st, %http::<st, %http::>sh, and
   %http::>sh format codes.

* Initialize HttpMsg::hdr_sz in HTTP header parsing code. Among other
   uses, this field is needed to initialize HTTP fields inside ICAP ALE.

* Synced default icap_log format documentation with the current code.


Regards,
Eduard.

	Content-Length values
Message-ID: <79c6baba-6fd3-13c8-86ac-c9b5ce75bd13@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    Squid is violating HTTP MUSTs by forwarding messages with
problematic Content-Length values. Some of those bugs were fixed in
trunk r14215. This change handles multiple Content-Length values inside
one header field, negative values, and trailing garbage. Handling the
former required a change in the overall Content-Length interpretation
approach (which is why it was previously left as a TODO).

Squid now passes almost all Co-Advisor tests devoted to this area. We
are not 100% done though: We still need to handle malformed values with
leading signs (e.g., "-0" or "+1"). However, I hope that the remaining
problems are relatively minor. I do not plan on addressing them in the
foreseeable future.

Also improved httpHeaderParseOffset(): Added detection of overflowing
and underflowing integer values; polished malformed value detection code
(Linux strtoll(3) manual page has a good example). The function no
longer considers empty strings valid and reports trailing characters.
The function still accepts leading whitespace and signs. It is still the
wrong approach to HTTP numbers parsing, but further improvements are out
of scope because they are complicated and would require significant
caller rewrites.


HTH,

Alex.

+1. Looks okay to me. With one caveat:

Since there are several of these interpreters for special-cased headers
I think we need to define a sub-namespace for header
interpreters/parsers, etc. Does keeping the existing "Hdr" term seem
like a good idea to you?

* If so please move ContentLengthInterpreter to a Http::Hdr:: namespace
and ContentLengthInterpreter.{h,cc} files in a matching directory.

* Otherwise, please at least place the class within the Http:: namespace
and directory etc.


(PS. I plan to bundle next 4.x within the next 2-3 days. I leave it to
you to decide whether this gets applied now or after release).

I am not sure I understand or agree with your logic for deciding when to
add a namespace. A namespace is primarily a name clash avoidance
mechanism. What name clashes are you trying to avoid by adding a "header
interpreters/parsers" namespace?

As an illustration, consider the standard library that provides a lot of
things, including a lot of similar things (e.g., stream classes or math
functions). How many namespaces does std contain? I knew of only a
couple before I looked it up. There are actually about a dozen
"standard" ones, but all the ones I checked are concerned with name
clashes, not just grouping similar things together.


> Does keeping the existing "Hdr" term seem like a good idea to you?

Not sure what you mean. Are you suggesting to rename
ContentLengthInterpreter to ContentLengthHdrInterpreter? That looks like
a clash of naming styles to me.

> and ContentLengthInterpreter.{h,cc} files in a matching directory.

I recommend leaving ContentLengthInterpreter class name as is. The class
interprets Content-Length headers to find their intended meaning during
parsing. It is not meant to be an Http::ContentLength class that
stores/manages/writes parsed Content-Length information.

If that is not going to create linking problems, I can move the
ContentLengthInterpreter class into http/one/ContentLengthInterpreter.*
files and place it inside the existing Http::One namespace. Would that
be sufficient to address your concerns?


> (PS. I plan to bundle next 4.x within the next 2-3 days. I leave it to
> you to decide whether this gets applied now or after release).

I would prefer to commit now, but that requires reaching an agreement
regarding ContentLengthInterpreter name and location as discussed above.


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Must revalidate CC:no-cache responses
Message-ID: <57C9F9BE.2060002@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch forces Squid to always revalidate Cache-Control:no-cache
responses.

Squid MUST NOT use a CC:no-cache response for satisfying subsequent
requests without successful validation with the origin server. Squid
violated this MUST because Squid mapped both "no-cache" and
"must-revalidate"/etc. directives to the same ENTRY_REVALIDATE flag
which was interpreted as "revalidate when the cached response becomes
stale" rather than "revalidate on every request".

This patch splits ENTRY_REVALIDATE into:
- ENTRY_REVALIDATE_ALWAYS, for entries with CC:no-cache and
- ENTRY_REVALIDATE_STALE, for entries with other related CC directives
   like CC:must-revalidate and CC:proxy-revalidate.

Reusing ENTRY_CACHABLE_RESERVED_FOR_FUTURE_USE value for the more
forgiving ENTRY_REVALIDATE_STALE (instead of the more aggressive
ENTRY_REVALIDATE_ALWAYS) fixes the bug for the already cached entries -
they will be revalidated and stored with the correct flag on the next
request.


Regards,
Eduard.

I meant Http::Hdr:: , so the things currently namesd HttpHdrFoo can be
moved there alongside this one as they get updated.

It interprets the header in context of RFC7230 (HTTP) rules about what
Content-Length can contain. Other protocols should have their own rules
and handling. ie whether hex representation is permitted, extra ';q='
parameters, and such.

If any other protocol wants to re-use the HTTP rules enforced by this
class they can typedef in their own namespace, or use the Http::Foo
class directly. Which makes the relationship (copying HTTP
interpretation rules) to HTTP explicit in the other protocols code.

Http::One is not appropriate since these rules also apply to Http::Two::
mime header blocks as well. So somewhere under Http:: is right
regardless on whether the Http::Hdr:: idea is used or not.

I would realy like it to be under Http:: and in http/ the rest is okay
to skip.

Sounds good. I have no problems with moving that code into http/ and
Http::. It is certainly appropriate, especially if you expect HTTP/2
code to benefit from this class. I hope the linker will not have any
problems with that move either.

Unfortunately, I may not be able to work this long weekend, so I may not
be able to do this until Tuesday and may miss your packaging deadline.
Feel free to commit/move this code yourself, of course.


Thank you,

Alex.

in src/http.cc:

* ccPrivate is only cacheable in the same conditions as
ccNoCacheNoParams so should be a ENTRY_REVALIDATE_ALWAYS as well.
 - this also affects the debugs() in src/refresh.cc syign why it needs
to revalidate.

It is unclear what are these "same" conditions. RFC 7234 5.2.2.6:

    The "private" response directive indicates that the response message
    is intended for a single user and MUST NOT be stored by a shared
    cache.

In my understanding Squid (as a shared cache) must not store "private"
responses at all (while user agents could). Is this correct? If yes,
currently Squid violates this MUST.

On the other hand, "no-cache" without field-names does not impose
constraints on storing in the cache, but restricts the cache to always
revalidate.

That is correct as the protocol RFC goes.

However we still have people wanting the nasty refresh_pattern
ignore-private option. In order to minimize the security issues that
causes anything marked as CC:private that does get into cache needs to
be revalidated on every use just like CC:no-cache.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Handling syntactically valid requests with
 higher-than-supported HTTP versions
Message-ID: <57CDDE5B.6050405@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch fixes Squid to return 505 (Version Not Supported) error
code for HTTP/2+ versions.

Before this change, when a syntactically valid HTTP/1 request indicated
HTTP major version 2, Squid mangled and forwarded the request as an
HTTP/1 message. Since Squid does not and cannot correctly interpret an
HTTP/1 request using HTTP/2 rules, returning an error and closing the
connection appears to be the only correct action possible.

Also: since HTTPbis prohibits HTTP versions with multi-digits, treat
such requests as invalid.

Attached Co-Advisor result pages for patched and unpatched Squid.


Regards,
Eduard.

in matchDomainName you removed the comment:
"
    * This is a match only if the first domain character
    * is a leading '.'.
"

That comment is still true. The squid.conf domain still needs to begin
with a '.' for the match to return true from that if-statement.
What you are changing is that other flag conditions also apply.

Other than that +1. Please apply ASAP.

That is not true. The trunk code returns false the same as this patched
version. Because the version field for HTTP/2 does not start with the
static magic string "HTTP/1."

That is not correct either. The old logic requires method to be GET for
full HTTP/0.9 handling. HTTP/2 pseudo-method is PRI. If anything other
than PRI is seen it is not valid HTTP/2.
 At most we should have logic passing HTTP/2 transparently through the
proxy (configurable). Which is the relay behaviour of HTTP/0.9
processing, but not its header mangling behaviour (because PRI, not GET
method).

In the case where it is not HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/2, or GET without a
version field. Then the version must start with "HTTP/" to be considered
invalid HTTP version and the MUST clause applicable.

Otherwise it could be any protocol at all. HTTP/2, SMTP, Finger,

For some reason I'm not sure of yet these changes result in unit test
failure parsing a garbage line with various bad whitespace characters in it.

make check with testHttp1Parser debugging enabled produces:
"

Just noticed that the unit test for "GET / HTTP/2.0" request-line is
also failing due to this parser change now accepting that invalid
version as valid.

I think this other fail is due to "2.0" meeting both the version layout
and the "multiDigits' conditions. You should use
tok.skip(Http1::MagicPrefix) instead of trying to count digits in the
major version. This is an HTTP/1 parser, non-1.x versions (except 0.9
special case) are all unsuccessful parse if they occur here.

That trend goes all the way back to at least 2.6. Which is a bit weird,
since it contradicts the total request-per-second capacity we have been
watching in polygraph results.

The speed per request goes down and the number that can be handled rises.

As far as my simple observations have been, the per-request slowdown
correlates to the amount of code being added (ie new features) and also
to the amount of AsyncCalls involved with the request handling (where
more AsyncCall is more latency).

The AsyncCall correlation kind of explains the capacity vs speed
relationship. As Calls make more transactions happen in parallel the
fixed CPU resource gets spread thinner.

I thought you had noticed this several years ago and it was behind your

watching it for a while.

I do not know what you mean by "total request-per-second capacity", but
I most likely have not been watching it. Is there a historical results
table for that measure that I can study?


> The speed per request goes down and the number that can be handled rises.

Even if concurrent transactions handling has been improving (and that is
a big if -- I have no data to back it up), it does not excuse the
significant worsening of per-transaction performance IMO.

Additional code obviously slows things down, but the existing rate of
adding new features/async calls does not seem to match the magnitude of
the measured performance decline, especially for the basic code paths
tested by these micro tests. For things to be getting worse in such a
manner, we probably have to make the old code/features worse (in
addition to adding new features/async calls) and/or adding those new
features in a terribly inefficient way.

Disagree: the trunk Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
returns true, because it treats HTTP/2 message as HTTP/0.9
message. You can see this in my Co-Advisor attachment in "HTTP/1.1
device MUST NOT use 2.1 HTTP version in requests" test case.

Not sure that is what Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
should care of. In my understanding, this method should parse the input
with HTTP/1 rules, returning false if the input does not conform to
these rules.

OK, and the patched Squid would return 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported)
for HTTP/1.2+.(it is not yet implemented).

I suspect that test should be changed to check for 505 error code instead
of 400.

I count digits in order to differentiate syntactically valid(but
unsupported by Squid) HTTP versions and invalid(multi-digit)
ones, returning 505 or 400 codes respectively.

 idle ICAP connections Part2
Message-ID: <70acee5d-f55a-a4fb-5871-6b3748ced001@chtsanti.net>

A preview of this patch originally discussed under the "[PATCH] Bug 4430 
Squid crashes on shutdown while cleaning up idle ICAP connections" mail 
thread on squid-dev:
   http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2016-March/005214.html

We fixed the patch so I hope it handles most of the Amos objections for 
the first patch.

Patch description:

The global Adaptation::Icap::TheConfig object is automatically destroyed 
when Squid exits. Its destructor destroys Icap::ServiceRep objects that, 
in turn, close all open connections in the idle connections pool. Since 
this happens after comm_exit has destroyed all Comm structures 
associated with those connections, Squid crashes.

This patch uses updated RegisteredRunners API to close all connections 
in existing connections pools before Squid cleans up the Comm subsystem.

Also added a new IndependentRunner class to the RegistersRunner API, 
which must be used for runners that are destroyed by external forces, 
possibly while still being registered. IndependentRunner objects 
unregister themselves from Runners registry when they are destroyed.

The finishShutdown() method is now virtual and may be overloaded to 
implement independent runner cleanup during main loop (and/or to support 
complex cleanup actions that require calling other virtual methods). The 
method is still called for all registered runners but it no longer 
destroys the runner. For dependent runners, the destruction happens soon 
after the finishShutdown event ends but also during the main loop 
(unless the runner has managed to register after the main loop ended).

This patch replaces the r14575 temporary fix.

This is a Measurement Factory project.

I assume this has had enough testing since it last came up for audit.

Please take the opportunity when touching code lines to remove HERE from

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Revalidate without Last-Modified
In-Reply-To: <57C6E494.60505@measurement-factory.com>
References: <57C6E494.60505@measurement-factory.com>
Message-ID: <57D296A3.1010805@measurement-factory.com>

Made a couple of fixes:

* avoid needless updates when a [revalidation] reply lacks Last-Modified

* compilation errors while running test-builds.sh

Also attached a port to v3.5.

Subject: [squid-dev] New Defects reported by Coverity Scan for Squid
 after IndependentRunner
In-Reply-To: <57d1a3bf49679_23c86953344621d@ss1435.mail>
References: <57d1a3bf49679_23c86953344621d@ss1435.mail>
Message-ID: <3e966876-ff97-8bb7-40ce-a9542abd2311@treenet.co.nz>

These issues are caused by the new RegisterRunner() design using
GetRidOfRunner(rr) if shutdown has already begun. That can potentially
result in the constructor of a class inheriting from IndependentRunner
deleting 'this', then the new'd object being used.

I think what we should be doing is using Must(RegisterRunner(this))
instead of just RegisterRunner(this) for children of IndependentRunner
so their constructors throw on errors.

Also the IndependentRunner::registerRunner() method is not used
anywhere. Was it supposed to be called by the child classes ?

Aggr...
However the GetRidOfRunner will never delete an IndependedRunner, so 
there is not a real problem here.
But yes it is confusing as is.

Well, the registerRunner() method should be used instead of 
RegisterRunner for ConnStateData and IDleConnList. But this change 
somewhere lost while I was playing with the patches.

However this is alone I think will not solve the problem.
Maybe we need to re-implement  registerRunner() with something like:

IndependedRunner::registerRunner() {
     RegisterRunnerIgnoreOnShutdown();
}

The RegisterRunnerIgnoreOnShutdown() is similar to RegisterRunner but it 
will not call GetRidOfRunner().

To be more precise, there is a Coverity problem here, not a Squid
problem, right?

That does not sound right: AFAICT, the code logic does not really
require successful registration of [independent] runners so it would be
inappropriate to throw when registration fails. In other words, a failed
independent runner registration does not indicate a bug in the code AFAICT.

IIRC, the current RR API does not guarantee emitting (and the code
should not rely on receiving) any RR events. If we want to make that
guarantee, we would probably have to supply a list of events (that a
specific RR must receive) to the registration function. I do not think
we need it, but please let me know if I missed any good use cases for
that functionality.

[rant] Which means our testing was inadequate again. Accidents happen,
but such a major bug should not have went unnoticed if proper testing
was in place.[/rant]

Just to make sure we are on the same page: Which problem are you trying
to solve? A false USE_AFTER_FREE defect reported by Coverity?

To avoid code duplication, you will need something like this:

void
RegisterRunnerUnlessShutDown(rr)
{
    if (FindRunners())
        RegisterRunner_(rr);
    // else do nothing past finishShutdown
}

bool
RegisterOrGetRidOfRunner(rr)
{
    if (FindRunners()) {
        RegisterRunner_(rr);
        return true;
    } else {
        GetRidOfRunner(rr);
        return false; // past finishShutdown
    }
}

where RegisterRunner_() is a static void function that never calls
GetRidOfRunner() and throws if it cannot FindRunners().

One advantage of this more verbose/explicit solution is that it
minimizes fears about using dynamic_cast<> on a being-constructed
object. I think the current code is actually OK there, but avoiding that
question is a good thing so I support this change.


Thank you,

Alex.

There is a "delete this" inside constructor, but it is never called.
The Coverity just does not know that it is not called.

I am not sure if it is problem or not. Someone can argue that even if it 
is not called may confuse developers in the future and make them to add 
a  "delete this" inside the GetRidOfRunner which will be called.

Yep.
But it is not exactly bug. The registereRunner() method just calls 
"RegisterRunner(this)", it does not do anything else.
Just we did not replace RegisterRunner(this); with the 
IndependedRunner::registerRunner call.

OK, I will try to prepare a patch on this base.

Ah, this is minor, and no functionality testing could expose this. I
incorrectly thought that we are not registering independent runners at all.

BTW, you can probably move the sketched RegisterRunnerUnlessShutdown()
function into the IndependedRunner::registerRunner() itself and also add
a Must(not an independent runner) check to the sketched
RegisterOrGetRidOfRunner().


Thank you,

Alex.

Well it is rare-ish, but I think it can happen with ConnStateData if a
connection is accepted after shutdown starts during the grace period
witing for client connections to finish up.

What I was thinking was to have this:

 IndependedRunner::registerRunner() {
    Must(RegisterRunner(this));
 }

constructors are allowed to throw, so if it is not caught by the
Call/callback handler from accept() thats a separate issue to fix.

Well, I'm still in slight disagreement with Alex on how to group things
-though that is mostly because we have not discussed it properly.

If a sub-struct name cannot be agreed then bool members in the LogTags
object is better than calling a sub-struct "flags" and only putting
flags for failure conditions into it.

I leave the final choice to you Eduard, we can always change it again
after later discussions.

Yes, the registration may be "late", but the committed code supports
late registrations well AFAIK -- there is no functionality bug. There is
an unused method. I trust Christos will fix that (and improve
surrounding code while he is at it).

I misinterpreted Christos earlier response and thought that there is a
major bug that we missed. That major bug does not exist. The code works
OK but needs some polishing.

It is wrong to throw when things are working OK. A failed RR
registration is not a bug; it is only a late registration that can be
ignored.

Hi,
  As you have obviously spent some effort in this, would it be possible to
share these benchmarks with the larger community, possibly by leveraging
the automations we are already using?

I move the code of sketched RegisterRunnerUnlessShutdown to
IndependentRunner::registerRunner()

Also I did not rename the RegisterRunner() to 
RegisterOrGetRidOfRunner(), to avoid changes in places other than 
runnersRegistry.[cc,h] files..

Now there is Must to assure that the RegisterRunner will not called to 
register an IndependentRunner.

The final commit is the patch r14835.

Not sure what you mean by sharing benchmarks but I can, of course, share
detailed test results and [trivial] Polygraph workloads that were used
for these tests. However, they have no significant value on their own,
and their unpolished specifics are likely to distract us from the core
problem. What value do you see in publishing those dirty details?


> possibly by leveraging the automations we are already using?

Sorry, I do not know what that means. AFAICT, the Project (i.e., "we")
is not using any automated performance testing at this time (or it is so
broken that it does not even detect the obvious trend above). I do not
have enough cycles to fix and maintain that myself, but I have sent the
Foundation Board a specific proposal on how to address that problem.

I don't sorry. The data except the last test run has expired from the
polygraph build node history.

Since the test was a bit unreliable I ran it freshly against each branch
that would build when I wanted to check progress.
The last test run can be found in parserng-polygraph if you want to dig
into the logs for other measures.

branch    : Mean RPS
--------------------
parserng  : 1927.84
squid-3.2 : 1933.98
squid-3.3 : 1932.81
squid-3.4 : 1931.12
squid-3.5 : 1926.13

The fluctuation / error bars seemed to be about 1 RPS for that polygraph
workload. So it looks like almost holding steady by that measure.

Hi all,

As you should know, Squid-4 release has been blocked in beta state for
most of a year now.

To make progress the top item on my checklist is that we have these 7
major (or higher) bugs which need to be either fixed or downgraded or
shown that they exist in older versions. When that is done I can move on
to checking the other pieces for a release.

Sorry, I do not know how to get to "parserng-polygraph". All Jenkins
results published at http://build.squid-cache.org/ appear to be too old,
but perhaps I am looking in the wrong place. It is probably not
important for this specific discussion though.

Looks like performance may be gradually getting worse in this macro test
as well, but the decrease is not as visible/pronounced as in micro tests
(which is understandable/expected, of course).


> The fluctuation / error bars seemed to be about 1 RPS for that polygraph
> workload.

Please correct me if I am misinterpreting what you are saying, but to me
it sounds like "The results are not getting gradually worse because each
result has a ~1 rps precision". That conclusion does not compute for me
for two independent reasons:

1. There is a significant difference between results fluctuation and a
trend. Individual test results fluctuation may co-exist with a
real/meaningful downward trend. Whether that happens here, I do not
know, but your comment appears to imply that you are dismissing the
visible trend for the wrong/inapplicable reason.

2. Even if 1 unit difference is insignificant, the results show that the
performance got worse by 7+ units (~1934 vs ~1926).

BTW, I would caution against thinking of these numbers as RPS. That test
is not designed to predict sustained request rates. A 1 unit difference
in these results may correspond to ~0% or, say, ~10% difference in
actual sustained request rates.

Alex.

Why "downgrade"? The importance of a bug should not go _down_ after
confirming (or assuming) that the bug affects several Squid versions.
You might ignore the old bug for the purpose of assigning various labels
to Squid branches, but downgrading it for that reason seems inappropriate.

Downgrading because others cannot reproduce seems inappropriate.
Treating the bug as UNCONFIRMED would the right cause of action if
nobody but Yuri can confirm it. The current MOREINFO state can also be
used as an excuse to ignore this bug for the purpose of assigning
various labels to Squid branches *if* you think that there is actually
no bug there (and that getting more info will only confirm that).

Downgrading bug severity because nobody is working on a fix is wrong.

Please note that Eduard is working on fixing that bug, and the bug
metadata (i.e., the Assignee field) reflects that fact (to the extent
our Bugzilla can reflect it). We are on the tenth patch revision, but
are probably approaching usable state.


HTH,

I cannot track the effects of all the proposed low-level fixes, of
course, but no changes jumped at me as wrong. IIRC, Eduard tried quite a
few test cases in hope to weed out the bugs. The underlying code was in
poor shape, on several levels. This patch does not solve all the
problems, but at least Squid should stop lying about several sizes that
folks are often monitoring (and some icap.log codes should be
interpreted in a more consistent/orderly fashion).

I have not seen any public reviews for this patch. If there are no
last-minute objections, I will commit these important fixes to trunk soon.


Cheers,

Alex.

I've also not had time to do any thorough check, but with a quick
read-through nothing stands out as broken.

Just the new cf.data.pre docs for icap_log contradicting itself:

"
  http::>h	...
      HTTP response headers in RESPMOD) ...
      currently does not support logging of HTTP response headers in
RESPMOD ...
"

I think that should probably be saying it does not support HTTP
*request* headers in RESPMOD.

Agreed, which is why that second statement. IF someone can reproduce -
the description seems clear enough to do so with a Windows network
setup. Then its a major bug (affecting many people using Squid),
otherwise it is limited to the one network which other evidence shows is
broken in many ways down to and below the TCP level. It might even be
fixed already for all we can tell.

Almost every bug is a major/critical/blocker issue for those noticing
its affects. The severity rating for the project needs to be
estimated/determined by how widely it can be expected to affect the
Squid community.

Some context:
* only affecting one person AFAIK,
* on a network with visibly borked TCP layer,
* running proxy on a uncommon proprietary OS (Solaris),
* with custom patches IIRC,
* person has a history of reporting almost all bugs as
blocker/critical/major to get attention,
* person has a history of actively inhibiting bug resolution when
frustrated by progress.

Why penalize the whole world for one admins somewhat unusual conditions?

Given the above context I am doubting the bugs severity rating is
anywhere near accurate in regards to what the wider community will see.
But it still needs 'more info' or replication.

It is on the choppign block for downgrade because AFAIK it has not been
causing noticable issues to those currently using Squid-4.

I assume you are talking about this blob:

> To-be-adapted HTTP message headers sent by Squid to
> the ICAP service (HTTP request headers in REQMOD; HTTP
> response headers in RESPMOD). Please note that Squid

I will clarify that when committing:

http::>h   To-be-adapted HTTP message headers sent by Squid to the ICAP
service (i.e., HTTP request headers in REQMOD or HTTP response headers
in RESPMOD). However, Squid cannot currently log HTTP response headers
sent to the ICAP service (i.e., %http::>h will expand to "-" for RESPMOD
transactions).

Does that sound better?


If the above polished version does not clarify things enough, here is
what is going on:

* The logformat %code is for logging HTTP message headers sent by Squid
to the ICAP service. That will not change and is now properly
documented. What are those to-be-adapted HTTP headers? They are HTTP
request headers in REQMOD and HTTP response headers in RESPMOD. We did
not have to say that, but providing that detail is helpful IMO.

* However, currently, Squid cannot log HTTP response headers sent by
Squid to the ICAP service. The admin will always see "-" in that
specific case. Hopefully, that support will be added in the future. For
now, we just document the lack of support in that particular case.


Thank you,

Alex.

Better, but I think remove the words "or HTTP response headers in
RESPMOD" from that first statement. The second sentence now explains the
RESPMOD clearly all by itself.

I have no problems with what you are saying now. I still have problems
with downgrading bug severity level if nobody can reproduce. Perhaps
your "downgrade" means something else or perhaps we are using different
strategies to defining what bug importance/severity field represents.
More on that below.


> The severity rating for the project needs to be
> estimated/determined by how widely it can be expected to affect the
> Squid community.

Please note that I was and still am discussing specific bug metadata,
such as the importance/severity rating field, not any derived metrics.

There are at least two strategies when dealing with the
importance/severity rating field:

* Adjusting severity rating based on the bug spread is a valid strategy.

* The alternative strategy is to separate severity from "reproducibility
in multiple environments". I favor this strategy because it is simpler
and because it reduces tensions between those who suffer from the bug
and those who maintain bug metadata.


With _either_ strategy, when it comes to deciding what to do about the
bug as far as marking Squid branch as stable is concerned, it is too
easy and too convenient for us to misinterpret the absence of "me too"
bug comments as a sign that a bug spread is narrow. Folks suffering from
these bugs may not read your squid-dev post implicitly threatening them
to "ignore" the bugs they are suffering from. I am not saying there are
such folks for this particular bug. I am saying that the approach itself
is dangerous. To reduce that danger, we should be posting these warnings
to squid-users (and to each affected bug report).

Nobody has proposed to penalize the whole world. I am objecting to
adjusting bug metadata (your "downgrading") without sufficient grounds
for doing so. I am _not_ objecting to ignoring that bug for the purpose
of assigning various labels to Squid branches (with sufficient grounds
for doing so). The two actions are very different IMO.

The "context" bullets you provide can be the reasons to ignore this bug
while deciding whether to mark v4.0 as stable. They are not the reasons
to change bug metadata (using the metadata maintenance strategy I
recommend, as discussed above).

You are changing the goal posts: It was "nobody intends to work on it"
but now you are saying "nobody suffers from it". My earlier comment
naturally applies to the former goal posts.

As for the new "no noticeable issues" argument, it is even weaker than
the "nobody said they can reproduce it" argument discussed earlier! This
bug does exist in nearly all supported SMP caching environments. Like
many caching bugs, "noticing" this issue is difficult and narrowing it
down enough for a quality bug report requires analysis that most admins
cannot perform, but it is a rather serious HTTP (cache integrity) violation.

Again, you may decide to ignore this bug for the purpose of declaring
v4.0 as stable. However, you need a different reason for doing so. For
example, you can claim that the bug affects v3.5 as well.

Nobody can stop you from marking v4.0 as stable because the existing
formal stability requirements are very weak, but let's not upset users
even more and screw up bug management in the process: These negative
side effects are simply not necessary, and we will have more than enough
other negative side effects to deal with after v4.0 is pronounced stable!


Thank you,

Alex.

Hello,

This maybe a very naive question, but why is squid 4.x still using
manually crafted double linked list? (dlink) Why not just use std::list
instead?

Hi Adam.
That's a very good question. We are in fact slowly refactoring from our
custom data structures to std:: wherever appropriate. If you wish to join
the effort, patches are welcome :)

Subject: [squid-dev] [RFC] dns_wait_for_all
Message-ID: <d50bbe30-6e48-c9a0-fb74-711b987d361d@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    Currently, when connecting to an origin server, Squid sends
concurrent DNS A and AAAA queries and waits for both answers before
proceeding with the HTTP transaction. If the authoritative DNS server
(or something on its path) breaks or significantly delays IPv6 (AAAA)
transactions, then Squid waits until timeout, even if Squid already has
a usable IPv4 address from a successful A query. This naturally leads to
admins disabling IPv6, willingly or under external pressure.

As Happy Eyeballs algorithms and related discussions/measurements have
established, the best migration path to IPv6 requires making sure that
enabling IPv6 does not create [user-visible] problems. Once that is
accomplished, software can and should prefer IPv6 over IPv4 by default.
I hope that we do not need to revisit those discussions to accept that
principle.

Currently, Squid violates that principle -- enabling IPv6 leads to
user-visible problems, and those problems lead to IPv6 being disabled.


This will not fix all IPv6 problems, but I propose to modify Squid so
that it starts connecting after receiving the first usable DNS response:

I suggest to enable this option by default because it will help with
IPv6 adoption, but I certainly do not insist on that default.


While we call both queries "concurrent", Squid sends the AAAA query just
before sending the A query. All other factors being equal, IPv6 will
usually win the DNS race. However, even if AAAA loses, Squid will use
IPv6 the next time it needs to connect to the same server.


>From development point of view, support this feature properly means
creating an AsyncJob that will initiate DNS queries and update the
destinations list as the answers come in while informing the caller (if
it is still alive) of any new answers. Today, FwdState does
approximately this:

  1. Call peerSelect(&serverDestinations, fwdPeerSelectionComplete)
     and wait for the fwdPeerSelectionComplete callback.

  2. When fwdPeerSelectionComplete is called,
     start iterating over pre-filled serverDestinations.

To support, dns_wait_for_all, FwdState will do _approximately_ this:

  1. Call peerSelect(serverDestinations, fwdPeerSelected)
     and wait for the first fwdPeerSelected subscription callback.

  2. Every time fwdPeerSelected is called,
     start or resume iterating still-unused serverDestinations
     if we were actually waiting for the next destination to try.

The DNS code dealing with concurrent A and AAAA queries will need to be
adjusted to report the first answer while waiting for the second one.

It is questionable whether the new AsyncJob should continue running
(i.e., resolving more peer names) after FwdState is gone (or no more
retries are needed). However, I do not want to complicate this
discussion by introducing that side effect. We can decide to optimize
that later, with or without another configuration option to control the
behavior.

Once this new infrastructure is in place, we can accommodate IPv6
further by experimenting with limited semi-concurrent TCP connections
and other Happy Eyeballs-inspired tricks (with proxy specifics in mind).


Any better ideas or objections to adding dns_wait_for_all?


Thank you,

Alex.

In principle okay. However, I was intending to redesign the object we
store DNS RR results in to achieve this is a more useful way. Such that
instead of returning an array of IP addresses it returned an object
storing the Query label, then a chain of RR objects for that label.

That would give several other useful benefits beyond that speedup:

* slow DNS responses could add to the chain while earlier results are
still in Async queue pending delivery to a caller.
 - this would obsolete the need for dns_wait_for_all to be configurable.
Always respond on first result and append data if it comes in early enough.

* ip/fqdn caches can store older data up to some timeout in TTL / LRU
sequence.
 - resolving many DNS rotation issues, including certain type of Host
verify failures.
 - merging the IP and FQDN caches ??

* extensibility of RR type the DNS could lookup and present the callers.
 - needed by DANE and SRV lookups.

* one less memcpy cycle per IP address returned by DNS.
 - paid for by more chain dereferencing overheads.

If you are talking about Comm::ConnectionList/serverDestinations, then
that object will have to be redesigned to support this proposal, of
course. The object would also have to be safely shared across FwdState,
peer selection code, and DNS code for the proposed feature to work.

... and while the caller is going through the TCP connect steps. That
TCP connect may be unsuccessful, requiring another attempt, possibly
using a different address. We already have the retrying code in place
and I am not proposing to change those algorithms during this project,
but the timing of new destinations arrival will change.

I have nothing specific against making the proposed algorithm the only
one, but I am not sure that _all_ side effects of the current
resolve-everything-first code are useless in all environments. AFAICT,
supporting both algorithms is easy (it is supporting the proposed
algorithm that is difficult).

I am not sure the DNS cache should be affected by the new lookup results
handling algorithm or the new serverDestinations storage of those
results. AFAICT, the DNS cache should store each result independently
while serverDestinations stores an ordered collection of results (some
of which may come from the DNS cache).

If you think that caching must change as a part of this project, can you
detail the related caching changes you would expect or foresee? If
caching changes are mostly independent, then we can discuss them
later/separately (to stay focused).


Thank you,

Alex.

I mean Dns::LookupDetails, ipcache_addrs and rfc1035_rr.
The serverDestinations not changing (yet).

Something like:

* ipcache_addrs::in_addrs becomes a list of rfc1035_rr instead of array
if IP address. (or an equivalent type storing the same details in easier
to access type than 'rdata' uses).

* ipcache_addrs::bad_mask moved into rfc1035_rr for a mask on the
records in each RR separately.

* ipcache_addrs merged into Dns::LookupDetails.

OK. I will see what I can do in this regard.

If you think that "Flags" is too "neutral" for the sub-struct naming,

That sounds mostly unrelated to the problem at hand. If we need to alter
Dns::LookupDetails, ipcache_addrs, or rfc1035_rr in some significant
way, then we will come back to this discussion. Otherwise, it stays as a
separate/independent not-yet-discussed project.

I am pretty sure we have to change that field to implement
dns_wait_for_all functionality correctly. For example:

* we need to make its updates (from different jobs!) safe, with
easy-to-trace debugging.

* we need to support an EOF-like semantics to signal whether more
destinations may still be provided.


Thank you,

Alex.

I am attaching v3.5 port of this r14838 and also r14839 and r14840,
containing several related fixes.

Amos, are you willing to include this fix in v3.5? It is fairly small,
but ModXact::finalizeLogInfo() changes are difficult (for me) to check.

Subject: [squid-dev] Call for interested Squid developers to join our
	Coverity Scan team
Message-ID: <CA+Y8hcNBHvgRfMOqCJR7Pi8V3z5uOL_H6qdtsWJ__SKaKKrQKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
   The Squid project is benefiting of a kind donation from Coverity,
in the form of free ( as in beer ) access to their Coverity Scan
(https://scan.coverity.com/) static code analysis product to analyze
our code base for defects.
   The tool has highlighted in time several potential (and some real)
bugs; some other developers and I spend some time vetting, analyzing
and fixing those bugs.

We have evaluated the possibility opening up access to the reports to
everyone, but despite that being our wish, this is not technically
feasible.
What can be done is to grant access to parties requesting it; so if
you are interested in seeing, triaging or fixing bugs uncovered by
Scan, please drop me a note so that I may grant you access.
Details at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/CoverityTesting

Thanks!

I was hoping to let it slide. But since you ask, it is applied as 3.5
rev.14082

Just a reminder of this issue. Amos, is there anything to do
to move it forward? In my point of view, only the related unit test
is to be fixed, but probably I am still misunderstand something.

Thanks,
Eduard.

You had a few good points in your previous response. This has been
waiting me having enough time to go over the RFC logic in detail and
figure out where we are diverging on interpretation. Hopefully this week
sometime if not later today.

Subject: [squid-dev] FYI: trunk ContextPtr changes
Message-ID: <c4606505-302e-1654-58e8-b4ba32e6b47d@treenet.co.nz>

Hi all,
  Apologies in advance for any instability that might hit trunk SSL
support in the coming week or so. Or affects it might have on your
current OpenSSL-related works.

I am applying the patches removing the buggy Security::ContextPtr type
from trunk.

I have split the work into batches to prevent it being one huge hairy
change diff that nobody can read. If all goes well there should be zero
noticable effects. Though the Pointer type is implicitly adding
background logic changes to the reference counting, so its not a
completely non-logic change.

Cheers
Amos

AFAICT, the correct way to achieve your goals is to merge a branch
containing those "batches" as commits. That way, you get a single
top-level trunk commit that does not bother anybody (or can be undone if
it does) plus individual secondary commits that are available if
somebody needs to analyze the individual changes.

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Bug 3819: "fd >= 0" assertion in file_write()
 during reconfiguration
Message-ID: <1625c8e6-a186-c022-84fa-a07857438371@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    The attached trunk patch fixes bug 3819 in our tests.

Please note that the underlying problem may lead to other assertions,
including "NumberOfUFSDirs" in UFSSwapDir and "fd >= 0" in file_close().

Since trunk r9181.3.1, reconfiguration is done in at least two steps:
First, mainReconfigureStart() closes/cleans/disables all modules
supporting hot reconfiguration and then, at the end of the event loop
iteration, mainReconfigureFinish() opens/configures/enables them again.
UFS code hits assertions if it has to log entries or rebuild swap.state
between those two steps.  The patch disables or delays those activities
during reconfiguration.

The tiny assertion opportunity window hides these bugs from most proxies
that are not doing enough disk I/O or are not being reconfigured
frequently enough.


HTH,

Alex.

I think you are mistaking serverDestinations as being part of the DNS
operations. It is not.

serverDestinations is state in the FwdStateData 'Job', the IP addresses
used by it have to go through the peer selection 'Job' processing and
related access controls applied to whatever comes out of an ipcache
lookup 'Job'.

DNS lookups are buried 3+ 'Job' layers away on the other side of
ipcache. All they do is feed that cache with data.

If you are intending to alter serveDestinations operations, then please
dont call the option dns_* . It is a tcp_outgoing_* thing.

I am not thinking in those terms. serverDestinations today is populated
by peer selection code, based on DNS lookups (including DNS cache
lookups). Those DNS lookups create two problems that dns_wait_for_all is
solving (i.e., waiting for the second DNS query in each address
resolution transaction and waiting for all peer address resolution
transactions).

Agreed. serverDestinations state is shared among peer selection and
FwdState code. Today, the sharing is sequential: After peer selection
fills serverDestinations, FwdState starts using serverDestinations. The
sequential nature of this approach creates problems. Dns_wait_for_all
solves some of them.


> DNS lookups are buried 3+ 'Job' layers away on the other side of

Yes, there are many layers.

The DNS code itself does not quite feed the cache (it just sends an
answer to the requester which happens to be the cache), and the cache is
not quite a layer: A fresh DNS answer is given to both the cache and the
ipcache_nbgethostbyname() callback. There might be some unwelcomed
dependencies in the code that require that fresh answer to be cached,
but they should not exist and they are unimportant when we discuss high
level concepts.


> If you are intending to alter serveDestinations operations, then please

I do not recommend using the tcp_outgoing name prefix because the
directive has nothing to do with TCP (and everything to do with DNS).
However, I am not going to fight you on this -- we usually disagree on
how things should be named, and there usually are not enough formal
arguments that can be made to support a given name. If nobody speaks up,
you will be able to rename the directive however you want. I am
certainly not a big fan of dns_wait_for_all!

Needless to say, the directive name should reflect what the feature does
from Squid admin point of view (the code changes implementing the
feature are irrelevant when it comes to naming). The proposed feature
determines whether Squid waits for certain DNS lookups when forwarding
transactions to peers.


Cheers,

Alex.

Okay finally got to this. Sorry for the delay.

I think what confused me was the handling of the !multiDigits cases.

For the RequestParser::parseVersionField() the relevant bits are:

If a version label matches the "HTTP/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT pattern from
RFC 2616 it should not be handled as 0.9 syntax. All unacceptible
versions that begin with "HTTP/" should get a 505.

To be compliant with RFC 7230:

- versions 1.2 thru 1.9 accept and handle normally. That is a SHOULD
requirement in section 2.6 final paragraph (bottom of page 15).

- other single-digit versions should get the 505 error.

- versions with multiple digits should get the 505 error.

Message-ID: <F25802A5228F1345B9BD8093E210C3B90258268ED4@EXWCMS01.fanniemae.com>

Hello,

I had discussed with Amos a couple weeks back on the user mailing list with regards to getting a transparent proxy setup on an OSX machine. I'm having some issues running the test-builds.sh, but they all look like they are associated with compiling on OSX with deprecated APIs that are erroring the compile. I'm not sure if I should continue down the road to get the test-builds.sh running on OSX for this patch. But including the patch anyway.

Apple doesn't publicly expose the ioctl on /dev/pf(USE_NAT_DEVPF) nor return the forwarding information on the getsockname(!USE_NAT_DEVPF) and the code path attempts to use the getsockname(), which ends up with a forwarding loop. The patch adds, under _SQUID_APPLE conditional compilation as per request by Amos, calls /sbin/pfctl to get the redirect state information, similar to the method that mitmproxy does on OSX. I've been using this on 3.5.20 that I patched from a source bundle, with an embedded device off the wifi and Internet Sharing for a couple of weeks w/o issue. But the patch was slightly modified to compile on trunk (xstrerror => xstrerr).

Let me know if I should continue down the road on getting test-builds.sh running on OSX.

For every intercepted connection, this patch forks Squid to start a
shell (which then starts pfctl and awk) and then blocks Squid on that
shell output, right? That feels very expensive performance-wise. I
wonder whether Squid should emit a corresponding one-time warning, to
minimize the number of folks who are going to assume that this works
well under load and then complain that their Squid is "slow".

The awk part can be eliminated by parsing in Squid, but I am not sure
that optimization is worth it when there is so much overhead in this
code besides awk.

IMO, you should not be responsible for fixing any old test-builds.sh
bugs, only for the problems your changes add or cause.

Please rewrite using SBuf. AFAICT, what you want can be written without
all those unsafe C things like malloc() and snprintf() -- you are simply
concatenating a few strings to form a command.

Please propagate or otherwise handle execl() errors.

Please handle fdopen() errors instead of ignoring them and feeding a nil
pointer to feof().

Leaking "fp"? AFAICT, you are supposed to close "fp" instead of
pipefd[0] after fdopen() but I am not sure.


> +                debugs(89, DBG_IMPORTANT, HERE << "PFCTL failed to find state");

Leaking both "fp" and pipefd[0]?


> +    char rdaddr[MAX_IPSTRLEN + 6];

AFAICT, the input line may have more characters than that because ":",
"\n", and "\0" all consume space (I assume 6 is for the ":port").

Also, this declaration is not needed outside the while loop.


> +            char *portPtr = strchr(rdaddr, '\n');

Should not we reject truncated lines (without '\n') instead of hoping
that the port number or the address itself was not truncated?

This code has no effect AFAICT -- the loop will continue with or without
that if statement. Did you mean to break the loop on all other errors
instead?


I recommend removing "fp" and reading from pipefd[0] directly instead.
You can use Tokenizer to safely parse what you read without these
error-prone C tricks.

These temporary for-testing changes should not be a part of the patch.

Totally agree with that. For my use case, I'm using squid for a small number of 
embedded devices that don't have the ability to connect to the available WiFi 
network. The one-time warning sounds like a good idea. Is there a place that
you have to add the one-time message, or should I just add a static variable 
to determine if the warning has been displayed the first time down this code
path?

I had started to parse the results of the pfctl in squid, but came to the same
conclusion and decided to just leave the awk.

Thanks - I was mistaken and thought from the merge document you sent that
I should have run the test-builds.sh.

Makes sense; I've been out of writing C for quite a while and never was much of 
a C++ programmer. Does just using the appendf() method sound alright? And am I
correct that the method with throw an exception that should just rollup the stack?

If my memory serves, I think the FILE * returned from fdopen() is just a pointer to the 
same datastructure in the kernel that fd would be associated to. So I was under the 
impression that either a fclose(fp) or close(fd) should be equivalent. I wonder if closing
both would also be bad. I found a SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13691107/c-proper-way-to-close-files-when-using-both-open-and-fdopen.
I'll go ahead and change it to a fclose() - don't think it matters, but might be more consistent
since I was using buffered reading. But from here, I think, that we should only close
either fp or pipefd[0].

Will add the 3 extra characters. Is the MAX_IPSTRLEN that correct macro to use here?
I wasn't sure of what the max length of a IPv6 string and when I looked it up, I think
MAX_IPSTRLEN was a bit longer.

That was left over code that I forgot to pull out. When I was using popen(), for
some reason, the 2nd (or maybe 3rd) connection was returning an error
on fgets(). I was just trying to figure out what was going on.

The reason that I used fgets() instead of read() on the pipefd[0] is that I'm 
reading either the  length of rdaddr or until I read a newline, which ever 
comes first. If I used read(), if the length of the line was less than rdaddr len
(and there was more than one line), it could read the beginning of the next
Line. At least that is what I remember. I could use Tokenizer or it looks like
Just SBuf after I get the line since the tokenizing is pretty simple. But I think
 if I was to use just read(), I'd have to read a character at a time from the fd
and at that point would it be just better to keep track of when I hit the ':'
in the input stream. I could do that if you'd like.

Sorry - had meant to remove those prior to sending. I've made the changes other than
removing the use of fp and using the pipefd[0]. I can still make that change also, but
just wanted your feedback if it should be changed, if I missed something in
Tokenizer, and/or if you want me to throw the input stream into a SBuf or
Tokenizer instead of just using some C calls.

If nobody recommends a better place, then place the warning in your
code. "bzr grep WARNING src" for examples.

I did not send a merge document. You should run the test-builds.sh. I do
not know whether running test-builds.sh will expose any bugs you are
responsible for. If running test-builds.sh does not expose any bugs you
are responsible for [because of all the other bugs that you are not
responsible for], then simply say so.

Sounds bad to me. Just use SBuf::append() to concatenate strings and
characters instead of turning off many C++ protections by using printf()
or equivalent.

Yes, SBuf methods should throw on overflows and similar non-logic
errors. Whether your code can handle those exceptions correctly, I have
not checked.

It is not just a pointer -- there would be no reason to add all those
f*() functions if it were! FILE is a libc object with buffers. It also
includes a pointer to the kernel structures, of course.


> I'll go ahead and change it to a fclose()

Yes, that is the right solution if you insist on using FILE.

My recommendation was given with the above assumption in mind.

Yes, but it is not a problem if you parse correctly. Currently, you are
combining partial parsing with partial reading. Splitting them often
avoids nasty bugs that result from such combination.


> I could use Tokenizer or it looks like Just SBuf

You should use Tokenizer instead of manually parsing what looks like
trivial syntax. Parsing problems in the first patch version imply that
it is not as trivial as it may seem (or, to be more precise, parsing
trivial syntax by hand is still error-prone!).


> if I was to use just read(), I'd have to read a character at a time from the fd

Why not read, say, 4096 characters at a time?


> .... or if you want me to throw the input stream into a SBuf or
> Tokenizer instead of just using some C calls.

I do, but I cannot insist on that. You can stop polishing the patch as
soon as it has no known bugs. Others will decide whether to accept it.


Please note that you have not shared updated changes AFAICT. The
squid-3.5.20-osx-devpf-transparent.patch you attached looked old to me.


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [RFC] Support concurrent SBuf::c_str() calls
Message-ID: <8bc2b28f-1478-e391-1a40-f11d4fd1bf38@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    The current trunk code contains at least two serious bugs caused by
SBuf::c_str() misuse. Both known bugs looks similar:

> storeCreateEntry(storeUri.c_str(), storeUri.c_str(), ...);

and

> storeCreateEntry(uri.c_str(), uri.c_str(), ...);


Both use cases violate safe c_str() use conditions documented in the
long and occasionally YELLING description of that method. As you have
probably guessed by now, the c_str() method itself is not constant, so
calling c_str() twice often destroys the first c_str() result.

It is trivial to fix both violations, but it is very difficult to say
how many other similar violations are hidden in (or will be added to)
the code. I am sure we will continue to miss them during code reviews.

This particular problem is caused by the "used storage size" increment
in the SBuf::c_str() implementation:

>     *rawSpace(1) = '\0'; // terminate the buffer
>     ++store_->size; // protect the terminator character

The increment forces the second call to c_str() to re-allocate the
store, which usually destroys the still-in-use storage pointed to by the
first c_str() result.

If we remove the increment, then Squid will work as expected when using
two concurrent c_str() results.

With or without the increment, Squid may crash or misbehave when buggy
code appends to SBuf while a previous c_str() result is still in use:
With an increment, appending may destruct the previous c_str() buffer.
Without an increment, appending may overwrite the 0-terminator used by
the previous c_str() call.

Valgrind is able to detect the "concurrent c_str()s" bugs in the current
trunk. My Valgrind tests did not expose other related bugs when I
removed the increment, but that does not mean those other bugs do not
exist, of course.

Should we remove the increment to make concurrent c_str() calls safe?


Thank you,

Alex.

Sorry - I think it was Amos instead. Sometimes these mailing lists make me think like I'm talking to one person :-). But that is the problem that I'm having - I can't even run the test suite on a OSX machine prior to making any changed. Running the test suite ends in the btlayer-00-default with an error that stops the build during dist-clean due to:

ERROR: files left in build directory after distclean:
./src/cf_gen.dSYM/Contents/Info.plist
./src/cf_gen.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/cf_gen

Based on the names, my guess is that the Xcode compiler is generating some artifacts that dist-clean isn't expecting. I did find that I can run with the "--keep-going" flag, but that ends with a the equivalent error in btlayer-05-no-deps-esi. Do I run it this way and just grep the logs for FAIL or something?

Understood - I will use SBuf::append, for some reason I was thinking that I had the port as a numeric - does seem better to use append.

I wasn't sure if I should handle it or let it flow up, since if it was in an overflow state I would doubt I could handle this packet, but maybe the next connection would be successful.

I appreciate the suggestions, both from a standpoint of not having been writing C/C++ code for a long time and I'd rather have the code be more "consistent" with the rest of the application. That's why using some of the classes that is already in the app that I had no idea was even there I think is a good idea. The reading a char at a time - I was thinking about parsing as reading. Anyway, I had already started it prior to reading the "stop polishing".

You are right - such a pain in the environment that I'm developing in. Mac off in a segmented network, which doesn’t have access to where I'm emailing from. Let alone having to change proxy settings. So have to dump the patch on a jump host, which I forgot to update with the new and copied the old file down to my email host. This one should be updated.

Sounds like a good plan to me.

I recommend temporary adding an exception with Must(false) inside the
parsing code and testing what happens. This approach may give you enough
information to decide whether your code or the caller should be
responsible for handling parsing exceptions.

You need to tell SBuf how much to append(). read(2) does not 0-terminate
buf!

Too late: errno may already be different after close().

If possible, use one of the skip() methods to avoid the implication that
you are parsing host here (and to save a couple of CPU cycles).

Please note that Tokenizer has a method to extract integers. I am not
sure it will help you here, but it might.

If you can avoid code duplication, please do so.

These should be declared as static to avoid allocating/initializing lots
of bytes on every access and as constant to help the optimizer (and to
avoid future bugs). And you can move them inside the loop then -- they
are unused outside the loop.

In general, declare variables as late as possible and make them const if
possible.


Thank you,

Alex.

If I understand correctly, the Must(false) goes all the way up the stack to main and exits squid. If instead it falls thru and returns false - the connection will fail and the next connection another attempt at parsing. Or is the question that the call to token() or int64() throws an exception and how that is handled, e.g. put a try/catch block around the parsing?

Thanks - I totally missed that method.

Must(false) just throws an exception. Where that exception will be
caught before main() when thrown from your code, I do not know (perhaps
you already do). Must(false) is just a trick to check whether all
exceptions in your code will be caught/handled the way you want. The
alternative is to trigger real exceptions, but that is often a lot harder.

In general, we should be using as few try/catch as possible to
accomplish the desirable outcome. Thus, always adding try/catch "just in
case" is the wrong approach (I am _not_ saying you are doing that!).
Until Squid exception handling is improved, testing is often the best
way to find the right place.

If you decide that a try/catch is necessary, place it as high as
possible and please do not forget to print the caught exception. There
are examples in the code.


Please note that you do not have to catch exceptions even if they kill
Squid. The current lack of try/catchers around critical contexts is not
your problem. Add try/catch only if you think catching close to your new
code is necessary for your code to work well under more-or-less "normal"
conditions. I doubt it is currently necessary because you are not using
exceptions for benign errors.

Now leaking pipefd[0] on errors. Someday, Squid will have a auto-close
descriptor wrapper...

Nice rewrite! You can move the port declaration lower, and you should.
And no empty lines between the declaration and the single-statement code
that uses that declaration exclusively:

    SBuf host;
    if (...) {
       int64_t port = 0;
       if (...) ...
    }

> +    }

An infinite loop if the actual input contains, say, a single space and
nothing else? Or a token without brackets and colons? That is unlikely,
of course, but perhaps not completely impossible. I am not dictating
code, but to skip an arbitrary bad line you might need something like
this at the end of an iteration:

  // the combination covers all characters so we will make progress
  (void)tk.skipAll(anythingButLf); // silently skip any garbage
  (void)tk.skipAll(lf))
  // either at the beginning of the next line or eof


BTW, I believe the previous version of your patch had a similar infinite
loop problem, but now it became obvious, thanks to your nice refactoring.


Thank you,

Alex.

The reason it exists remember is to prevent other SBuf sharing that
storage MemBuf from thinking they can append to the storage oer top of
the terminator. Given that we have no easy knowledge of how the c_str()
is going to be used by the recipient code we cannot guarantee lack of
terminator is safe.
 If we could then rawContent() should have been used instead of c_str().

Time to push SBuf usage forward and aggressively remove the need for
c_str()?

Thanks Eliezer,

Anything you can do to improve the docs is very welcome. Simplicity is
the key thing needed with diagrams. I've started a few on the
ConfigExamples LinuxRedirect or features CacheHierarchy pages you can
use as style examples for consistency.

The icons I've tried to use are the classical networking set from Cisco
- Viso should already have those. Most admins should already be familiar
with that, or at least its fairly obvious to tell things apart for those
who don't.

With the small Squid logo icon (taken from the official Artwork images)
to represent the Squid program inside a particular machine.

The thing to watch out for with any icons you choose is whether they
have a proprietary license. I've preferred to use DiaGraph so far since
it only comes with free icons. But does not quite match Visio abilities.

I think I'll just leave the exception handling for the caller then. There really isn't anything that can be done to resolve the exception in the callee.

You are right - there is an infinite loop. I started to play with the tokenizing after I sent the patch and didn't see the infinite loop, but I don't think it is doing what I was attempting in the loop anyway. How about I get rid of the loop all together - I should be only getting one line from pfctl, and if the parsing fails -I should probably just be returning false anyway instead of attempting to find what I expect later in the buffer. I was trying to be safe from the parsing, but I'm starting to think I should just fail out of the parsing if the buffer doesn't have what I expect.

A different question - I'm wondering if I should move where this conditional compilation is being placed with regard to the other conditional compilation. I had put it in based on what the last compilation options I had used when attempting to get this working before looking in the code. I didn't know if this would be enabled by configure or some other macro that might be defined on OSX. But it looks like I have it inside the conditional compilation for !USE_NAT_DEVPF. Do you think it should be moved?

Regarding the test_builds.sh - got it to run with the --keep-going and grepped out of the logs - only PASS in the summary section. This was with the current patch. I'll run it again, but at least know that it is working.

Message-ID: <c0a87cc9-1b8a-a928-a663-33022f7d2575@treenet.co.nz>

We now seem to have had several patches successfully use members
declared with default values and/or with the "*this = Foo();" shortcut
for a reset/clear method.

So I think we can start using these to replace old C-style
initialization and clear() functions.

This patch begins by replacing the Config2 use of memset(). I for one am
constantly mistaking which of the Config objects has memset() applied to
it at the global level when reconfigure happens. Now we do not need to
care, each object handles its own clearing one way or another.

All other factors being equal, a single statement is better than a loop
with a similar statement inside.

I do not know enough about pfctl and the corresponding environment to
answer your question with certainty but it looks like your awk command
should should protect Squid from any irrelevant/garbage lines. If nobody
else speaks up, this is your decision to make.


> +    cmd.append("\" && $8 == \"");

These should probably be merged into one. If no other changes are
needed, this merge can be done during commit.

All should be "const". If no other changes are needed, these "const"s
can be added during commit.


> +            debugs(89, 5, HERE << "address NAT: " << newConn);

No HERE in trunk, but it can be removed during commit.

I also recommend showing "state" contents in case you are returning
false because the PFCTL output did not match your expectations.
Something like:

    debugs(89, 3, "no address in" <<
           Raw("PFCTL output", state.rawContent(), state.size());
    return false;

That will cover the important case of no/empty output as well.

I wonder whether we should [save and] return the errno here instead of
generic EXIT_FAILURE?

Sorry, I do not know. Amos may know the answer to this question.

Excellent.

I have no further comments about the code. Thanks a lot for polishing it!

The *this assignment works for pre-C++11 v3.5 as well. The default
values will not work there so we should be extra careful when
backporting affected code.


> So I think we can start using these to replace old C-style

Agreed. I wonder whether we should be consistent -- if some class data
members cannot use default initialization and some can, should we
initialize _all_ members in the constructor(s)?

Provided one line is always sufficient to get the NAT'ed address or to
detect a problem. Then yes returning false/fail is the right thing to do
there.

The one thing to be very careful of here is that results for different
IP addresses cannot get mixed up. The entire purpose of this lookup is
to guarantee reliability of the information being used. If it fails
people face real costs and painful trouble.

Please make sure that your code debugs() dumps the full pfctl line(s)
received at level DBG_DATA, and (only) on errors the relevant bit at a
higher level like 2 or 3 - the other functions debug output can give


Some other things about the current patch:

* for the address string buffers SQUIDHOSTNAMELEN is guaranteed to be
long enough to store a URL-format IP address with port information.
MAX_IPSTRLEN is only guaranteed to be able to hold one IP by itself (the
'extra' space is for some weird formats that can be found in the more
unusual corners of networking).

It might be best if the conditionals were re-arranged like so:

#if USE_NAT_DEVPF
... the /dev/pf stuff

#elif _SQUID_APPLE_
... this new pfctl stuff

#else /* !USE_NATDEVPF */
... the getsockname stuff ...

#endif

Since they are a inside the --enable-pf-transparent conditional
PF_TRANSPARENT wrapper, that should be all that is needed to enable it
on MacOSX.

Not something to worry about with this patch. That testing is more for
changes where behaviour with and without the feature being enabled gets
affected and needs to be tested.

This change is pretty isolated and you are not changing any of the
behaviour when its disabled. So you only need to test the build using
this new code works as expected.

The fact that it is failing might be a sign of other MacOS issues that
need attention unrelated to this patching. But may also be just missing
commonly used dependencies on your machine.

I was aiming towards that some years ago. But reality turned out to be
that some of the bigger classes had annoyingly long lists of members to
initialize, many of which did not exactly need it. And no compiler or
static checking detects patches that forget to set one if it was a
complex class with own default constructor (like our Pointer types,
which were frequently missed).

So these days I'm only setting the basic POD type members explicitly on
construct. If we can set them like this and skip defining a default
constructor entirely that would be even better for shrinking the code.

Yes, I know, but that increment not only prevents problems but _causes_
them as well: The increment may force the SBuf to realloc, which may
result in deallocation of the original storage still pointed to by the
earlier c_str() result.

Yes, with or without the increment, Squid may crash or misbehave when
buggy code appends to SBuf while a previous c_str() result is still in
use. The lack of increment is not safe. The presence of the increment is
not safe. The problems are different, but they exist with or without the
increment.


> Time to push SBuf usage forward and aggressively remove the need for

The need for c_str() will never go away because libraries outside of
Squid control need c-strings. And, due to the lack of proper QA, any
"aggressive push" affecting lots of Squid code is a recipe for a
disaster IMO.

The question is which c_str() implementation is safer? The one that may
crash Squid when called twice for the same SBuf in the same expression
or the one that may crash Squid when appending to the same SBuf in the
same expression? There are already two known cases of the former. There
are currently no known cases of the latter.


Overall, I know of three primary ways to implement c_str():

1. Always 0-terminate SBuf-used storage. Safest implementation possible,
but has serious negative performance overheads, especially for tokenizing.

2. Terminate the used storage at the time of c_str().

    2a. Increment the used storage size. Current implementation.
        Leads to problems discussed in this thread.

    2b. Do not increment the used storage size.
        Leads to other problems discussed in this thread.

3. Allocate and store a new c-string as needed, copying from the
storage. Safest implementation possible but has serious negative
performance overheads. These overheads affect different use cases than
those of #1.

Needless to say, we can add clever code to reduce risks associated with
some implementations. For example (these are just rough sketches/ideas):

a) Appending code in #2b can check whether it is about to overwrite the
0-terminator added by a previous c_str() call and, if yes, preserve the
old storage (we can preserve one such storage or maintain a global FIFO
queue).

b) C-string allocating code in #4 can maintain a global FIFO queue of
previously allocated but now supposedly unused c-strings to minimize the
risk of de-allocating a still used c-string.

c) C-string allocating code in #4 can delay allocation until it might be
needed, similar to how (a) decides that the 0-terminator is in danger.


Going forward, do you think we should:

i. Keep using #2a and rewrite the known double-c_str() code.
ii. Make double-c_str() code safe (i.e., switch to #2b).
iii. Add code to make the existing #2 implementation safer.
iiii. Switch to a completely different implementation like #1 or #4.


Thank you,

Alex.

Sorry I was not clear. I was not proposing a one-size-fits-all approach
that you were trying to enforce some years ago. The consistency I was
talking about has a single class scope. In other words:

* If, for a specific class C, some C members cannot use default
initializers, then none of the C members should use default initializers.

Is that a good rule? Do we need a rule here?

Sure, but the consistency I am worried about is about a different case
where we cannot avoid defining a constructor because some members
require non-constexpr initializers.

This approach is outdated because Raw() takes care of DBG_DATA. The best
general approach today is to use an appropriate non-DATA level for
debugs() while using Raw() for printing data inside those debugs():

  debugs(11, DBG_IMPORTANT, "always printed" << Raw(may be printed...));

By default, small strings are always printed while large strings are
only printed if DBG_DATA debugging level is enabled. The behavior can be
tuned by calling .minLevel() on the Raw object.


For example, given "large" input,

  debugs(89, 5, "successfully parsed" << Raw("pfctl input", ...));

will produce something like

  ... successfully parsed pfctl input

with ALL,5 but something like

  ... successfully parsed pfctl input[150]=large-input-here

with ALL,9.


HTH,

Alex.
