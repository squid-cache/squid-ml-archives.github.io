<PRE>2016-09-06 17:03 GMT+03:00 Amos Jeffries &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-dev">squid3 at treenet.co.nz</A>&gt;:

 &gt; &gt; This patch fixes Squid to return 505 (Version Not Supported) error
 &gt; &gt; code for HTTP/2+ versions.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Before this change, when a syntactically valid HTTP/1 request indicated
 &gt; &gt; HTTP major version 2, Squid mangled and forwarded the request as an
 &gt; &gt; HTTP/1 message.
 &gt;
 &gt; That is not true. The trunk code returns false the same as this patched
 &gt; version. Because the version field for HTTP/2 does not start with the
 &gt; static magic string &quot;HTTP/1.

Disagree: the trunk Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
returns true, because it treats HTTP/2 message as HTTP/0.9
message. You can see this in my Co-Advisor attachment in &quot;HTTP/1.1
device MUST NOT use 2.1 HTTP version in requests&quot; test case.

 &gt; &gt; Since Squid does not and cannot correctly interpret an
 &gt; &gt; HTTP/1 request using HTTP/2 rules, returning an error and closing the
 &gt; &gt; connection appears to be the only correct action possible.
 &gt;
 &gt; That is not correct either. The old logic requires method to be GET for
 &gt; full HTTP/0.9 handling. HTTP/2 pseudo-method is PRI. If anything other
 &gt; than PRI is seen it is not valid HTTP/2.
 &gt;  At most we should have logic passing HTTP/2 transparently through the
 &gt; proxy (configurable). Which is the relay behaviour of HTTP/0.9
 &gt; processing, but not its header mangling behaviour (because PRI, not GET
 &gt; method).

Not sure that is what Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
should care of. In my understanding, this method should parse the input
with HTTP/1 rules, returning false if the input does not conform to
these rules.

 &gt; Also, HTTP/2 does not obsolete HTTP/1.x RFC's, so there is an explicit
 &gt; possibility that HTTP/1.2+ will exist at some point. The IETF WG
 &gt; expectation is/was that 1.2+ (if any) would contain compatibility for
 &gt; HTTP/2+ features over HTTP/1.x syntax.

OK, and the patched Squid would return 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported)
for HTTP/1.2+.(it is not yet implemented).

 &gt; Just noticed that the unit test for &quot;GET / HTTP/2.0&quot; request-line is
 &gt; also failing due to this parser change now accepting that invalid
 &gt; version as valid.

I suspect that test should be changed to check for 505 error code instead
of 400.

 &gt; You should use tok.skip(Http1::MagicPrefix) instead of trying to count
 &gt; digits in the major version.

I count digits in order to differentiate syntactically valid(but
unsupported by Squid) HTTP versions and invalid(multi-digit)
ones, returning 505 or 400 codes respectively.
