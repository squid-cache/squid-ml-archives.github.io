Sorry, I do not know how to get to &quot;parserng-polygraph&quot;. All Jenkins
results published at <A HREF="http://build.squid-cache.org/">http://build.squid-cache.org/</A> appear to be too old,
but perhaps I am looking in the wrong place. It is probably not
important for this specific discussion though.

Looks like performance may be gradually getting worse in this macro test
as well, but the decrease is not as visible/pronounced as in micro tests
(which is understandable/expected, of course).


&gt;<i> The fluctuation / error bars seemed to be about 1 RPS for that polygraph

</I>
Please correct me if I am misinterpreting what you are saying, but to me
it sounds like &quot;The results are not getting gradually worse because each
result has a ~1 rps precision&quot;. That conclusion does not compute for me
for two independent reasons:

1. There is a significant difference between results fluctuation and a
trend. Individual test results fluctuation may co-exist with a
real/meaningful downward trend. Whether that happens here, I do not
know, but your comment appears to imply that you are dismissing the
visible trend for the wrong/inapplicable reason.

2. Even if 1 unit difference is insignificant, the results show that the
performance got worse by 7+ units (~1934 vs ~1926).

BTW, I would caution against thinking of these numbers as RPS. That test
is not designed to predict sustained request rates. A 1 unit difference
in these results may correspond to ~0% or, say, ~10% difference in
actual sustained request rates.

Alex.
