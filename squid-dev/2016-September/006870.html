<PRE> &gt; 2016-09-06 17:03 GMT+03:00 Amos Jeffries &lt;squid3 at treenet.co.nz&gt;:
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; This patch fixes Squid to return 505 (Version Not Supported) error
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; code for HTTP/2+ versions.
 &gt;  &gt; &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; Before this change, when a syntactically valid HTTP/1 request 
indicated
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; HTTP major version 2, Squid mangled and forwarded the request as an
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; HTTP/1 message.
 &gt;  &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; That is not true. The trunk code returns false the same as this 
patched
 &gt;  &gt; version. Because the version field for HTTP/2 does not start with the
 &gt;  &gt; static magic string &quot;HTTP/1.
 &gt;
 &gt; Disagree: the trunk Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
 &gt; returns true, because it treats HTTP/2 message as HTTP/0.9
 &gt; message. You can see this in my Co-Advisor attachment in &quot;HTTP/1.1
 &gt; device MUST NOT use 2.1 HTTP version in requests&quot; test case.
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; Since Squid does not and cannot correctly interpret an
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; HTTP/1 request using HTTP/2 rules, returning an error and 
closing the
 &gt;  &gt; &gt; connection appears to be the only correct action possible.
 &gt;  &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; That is not correct either. The old logic requires method to be 
GET for
 &gt;  &gt; full HTTP/0.9 handling. HTTP/2 pseudo-method is PRI. If anything other
 &gt;  &gt; than PRI is seen it is not valid HTTP/2.
 &gt;  &gt;  At most we should have logic passing HTTP/2 transparently through the
 &gt;  &gt; proxy (configurable). Which is the relay behaviour of HTTP/0.9
 &gt;  &gt; processing, but not its header mangling behaviour (because PRI, 
not GET
 &gt;  &gt; method).
 &gt;
 &gt; Not sure that is what Http::One::RequestParser::parseHttpVersionField()
 &gt; should care of. In my understanding, this method should parse the input
 &gt; with HTTP/1 rules, returning false if the input does not conform to
 &gt; these rules.
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; Also, HTTP/2 does not obsolete HTTP/1.x RFC's, so there is an explicit
 &gt;  &gt; possibility that HTTP/1.2+ will exist at some point. The IETF WG
 &gt;  &gt; expectation is/was that 1.2+ (if any) would contain compatibility for
 &gt;  &gt; HTTP/2+ features over HTTP/1.x syntax.
 &gt;
 &gt; OK, and the patched Squid would return 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported)
 &gt; for HTTP/1.2+.(it is not yet implemented).
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; Just noticed that the unit test for &quot;GET / HTTP/2.0&quot; request-line is
 &gt;  &gt; also failing due to this parser change now accepting that invalid
 &gt;  &gt; version as valid.
 &gt;
 &gt; I suspect that test should be changed to check for 505 error code instead
 &gt; of 400.
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; You should use tok.skip(Http1::MagicPrefix) instead of trying to count
 &gt;  &gt; digits in the major version.
 &gt;
 &gt; I count digits in order to differentiate syntactically valid(but
 &gt; unsupported by Squid) HTTP versions and invalid(multi-digit)
 &gt; ones, returning 505 or 400 codes respectively.


Just a reminder of this issue. Amos, is there anything to do
to move it forward? In my point of view, only the related unit test
is to be fixed, but probably I am still misunderstand something.

Thanks,
Eduard.
