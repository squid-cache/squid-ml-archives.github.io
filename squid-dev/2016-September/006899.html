All other factors being equal, a single statement is better than a loop
with a similar statement inside.

I do not know enough about pfctl and the corresponding environment to
answer your question with certainty but it looks like your awk command
should should protect Squid from any irrelevant/garbage lines. If nobody
else speaks up, this is your decision to make.


&gt;<i> +    cmd.append(&quot;\&quot; &amp;&amp; $8 == \&quot;&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> +    cmd.append(&quot;ESTABLISHED:ESTABLISHED\&quot; {print $5}'&quot;);
</I>
These should probably be merged into one. If no other changes are
needed, this merge can be done during commit.

&gt;<i> +        int xerrno = errno;
</I>
&gt;<i> +    pid_t pid = fork();
</I>
&gt;<i> +        int xerrno = errno;
</I>
&gt;<i> +        int xerrno = errno;
</I>
All should be &quot;const&quot;. If no other changes are needed, these &quot;const&quot;s
can be added during commit.


&gt;<i> +            debugs(89, 5, HERE &lt;&lt; &quot;address NAT: &quot; &lt;&lt; newConn);
</I>
No HERE in trunk, but it can be removed during commit.

I also recommend showing &quot;state&quot; contents in case you are returning
false because the PFCTL output did not match your expectations.
Something like:

    debugs(89, 3, &quot;no address in&quot; &lt;&lt;
           Raw(&quot;PFCTL output&quot;, state.rawContent(), state.size());
    return false;

That will cover the important case of no/empty output as well.

&gt;<i> +        enter_suid();
</I>&gt;<i> +        execl(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, cmd.rawContent(), NULL);
</I>&gt;<i> +        leave_suid();
</I>&gt;<i> +        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
</I>
I wonder whether we should [save and] return the errno here instead of
generic EXIT_FAILURE?


&gt;<i> A different question - I'm wondering if I should move where this
</I>&gt;<i> conditional compilation is being placed with regard to the other
</I>&gt;<i> conditional compilation. I had put it in based on what the last
</I>&gt;<i> compilation options I had used when attempting to get this working
</I>&gt;<i> before looking in the code. I didn't know if this would be enabled by
</I>&gt;<i> configure or some other macro that might be defined on OSX. But it
</I>&gt;<i> looks like I have it inside the conditional compilation for
</I>&gt;<i> !USE_NAT_DEVPF. Do you think it should be moved?
</I>
Sorry, I do not know. Amos may know the answer to this question.


&gt;<i> Regarding the test_builds.sh - got it to run with the --keep-going
</I>&gt;<i> and grepped out of the logs - only PASS in the summary section. This
</I>&gt;<i> was with the current patch. I'll run it again, but at least know that
</I>&gt;<i> it is working.
</I>
Excellent.

I have no further comments about the code. Thanks a lot for polishing it!

Alex.
