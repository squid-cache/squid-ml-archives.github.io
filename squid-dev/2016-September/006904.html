Sorry I was not clear. I was not proposing a one-size-fits-all approach
that you were trying to enforce some years ago. The consistency I was
talking about has a single class scope. In other words:

* If, for a specific class C, some C members cannot use default
initializers, then none of the C members should use default initializers.

Is that a good rule? Do we need a rule here?


&gt;<i> So these days I'm only setting the basic POD type members explicitly on
</I>&gt;<i> construct. If we can set them like this and skip defining a default
</I>&gt;<i> constructor entirely that would be even better for shrinking the code.
</I>
Sure, but the consistency I am worried about is about a different case
where we cannot avoid defining a constructor because some members
require non-constexpr initializers.

Alex.
