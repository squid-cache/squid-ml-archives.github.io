The current O(1) is achieved only through the way dlink requires an
iterator raw-pointer to be stored in the Entry itself, not the list
owner object. That itself is a yuck factor that causes us a lot of
pointer invalidation problems changing this code.

Going a step back to fundamentals. This list is just a part of the full
external ACL caching algoritm. It has a 1:1 pairing with the hash
'cache' member of the same class.

I'm now looking into the LruMap performance to replace the whole system.
I had thought this list replacement was an easy step to get part of the
complexity. But it seems not.

Long term I would like to drop lru_list (and maybe Entry too) from
external_acl in favour of a cache member of type LruMap hiding all the
complex stuff.

Ack, same opinion here.

Boost has some nice things but most of that is becomming standardised
faster than we are converting to use C++ properly. :-(
