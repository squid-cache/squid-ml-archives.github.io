You may know exactly how each algorithm works, but that does not really
matter in this context. What matters here is the _relative_ strengths
and weaknesses of an algorithm. That part is still a mystery (to me).
When is CRUSH better than CARP? When is CARP better than CRUSH?


&gt;<i> Please let me know if that is of interest to Squid
</I>
As of 04/18/2017, my personal answer to that question is &quot;why bother?&quot;.

As of 04/19/2017, my personal answer to that question is &quot;maybe&quot;: One
out of 2+ random(?) tests shows about the same CARP and CRUSH  results.
Another test shows better CRUSH performance. It is not clear to me
whether some other tests will show better CARP performance.

I hope the above clarifies my position. Others may have a completely
different opinion, of course, and my current position does not block
CRUSH acceptance.


Thank you,

Alex.
