</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * AFAIK, still nobody working on this. Requires a fair bit of redesign

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * seems to be an expected but undesirable consequence of being helper

</I>&gt;<i> My understanding of that bug report is completely different: The current

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any other issues that dont have bug reports I should wait for?
</I>&gt;<i> I recall several issues that might be worth waiting for (your call):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. PID file management changes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We fixed some of the problems in trunk r13867 but the current code still
</I>&gt;<i> badly mishandles SMP race conditions. We see a stream of related problem
</I>&gt;<i> reports from SMP installations that cannot reliably start, restart, or
</I>&gt;<i> send signals. The fix went through several major rewrites and review
</I>&gt;<i> cycles already, so I hope we are within a week of the final solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fix contains some Squid &quot;interface&quot; changes (exit codes, what
</I>&gt;<i> failures are considered fatal, level-1 messages, etc.) so it may be a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to get it in before a lot of folks start upgrading to v4. It
</I>&gt;<i> is your call though.
</I>
Ouch. Okay, thanks.

&gt;<i> 2. New transaction_initiator ACL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on squid-users and private requests, quite a few admins are likely
</I>&gt;<i> to need this ACL to better cope with regression-like problems related to
</I>&gt;<i> other recent improvements. Here is a quote from the being-reviewed patch
</I>&gt;<i> preamble:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This ACL is essential in several use cases, including:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * After fetching a missing intermediate certificate, Squid uses the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    regular cache (and regular caching rules) to store the response. Squid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    deployments that do not want to cache regular traffic need to cache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    fetched certificates and only them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    acl fetched_certificate transaction_initiator certificate-fetching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    cache allow fetched_certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    cache deny all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Many traffic policies and tools assume the existence of an HTTP client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    behind every transaction. Internal Squid requests violate that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    assumption. Identifying internal requests protects external ACLs, log
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    analyzers, and other mechanisms from the transactions they mishandle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    acl skip_logging transaction_initiator internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    access_log ... !skip_logging
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know whether v4 port is practical but it would be nice to have
</I>&gt;<i> this ACL in v4.
</I>
If it is not too intrusive to record the state info that needs then I'm 
okay backporting ACL types, though it is a new feature so v5 is 
indicated by the RoadMap policy when there is any doubt about its impact 
on stability.


&gt;<i> 3. Bug 4682 - With ssl_bump, squid can ignore ACL denied and serve page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a v3 bug, but it is almost fixed, and since the bug may have
</I>&gt;<i> disastrous consequences, you may want to get it in before calling v4
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;stable&quot;.
</I>
Ack.

&gt;<i> 4. [PATCH] Do not forward HTTP requests to dead idle peers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eduard has posted that improvement yesterday. If you think this is a bug
</I>&gt;<i> fix, then it can be committed to v4 later. Otherwise, its reviewed/final
</I>&gt;<i> version should be committed to v4 before calling v4 stable IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, please do not rush to create any new official branches after
</I>&gt;<i> changing v4 status: During to-git migration, I expect us to have enough
</I>&gt;<i> trouble with v5 already being &quot;out of place&quot;, and creating more such
</I>&gt;<i> branches before conversion is likely to make the matters worse.
</I>
There wont be any more official branching until v6, and that wont be 
within this calendar year. New monthly release tags should be the worst now.


Thank you
Amos
