In the long term the code using it will be refactored use SBuf or 
std::string anyway.  I think it would be best if anyone taking this 
request up try to do that migration early rather than trying to fix what 
is just a portability hack - and for a convenience function at that.

If that is too hard, making callers do the allocate bit themselves and 
xstrncpy() instead should be a good medium-term workaround.

</I>&gt;<i> but we cannot do the above until xstrndup() implementation is fixed.
</I>
Not even by moving that caller to xmalloc() for itself and use xstrncpy() ?

+1 if you update the patch to do the above. +0 otherwise  - ie. go ahead 
with commit if you want, but I'd rather see the fixed caller(s) fixed to 
use a more long-ish term fix.
