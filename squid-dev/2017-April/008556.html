I suspect it matches your experiences but not your interpretation of
those experiences. Squid has many examples where treating C++ as dark
magic (&quot;I cannot explain it, but this seems to compile, and that other
approach that should have worked did not&quot;) resulted in bad or even buggy
code. To benefit from C++11, we should learn the new language features
so that we can use (or avoid) them correctly without &quot;experiments&quot; and
guesswork.

If something contradicts our understanding of the standard, we should
figure out why _before_ jumping to workarounds. We do not have C++ gurus
on this list (unfortunately), but we can usually figure it out
collectively. This is especially important for commonly repeated
patterns like &quot;auto&quot; and &quot;move&quot; expressions.

In this particular case, if starless &quot;auto&quot; does not work for pointers,
we all need to know (and avoid) that and, vice versa, if starless &quot;auto&quot;
works great, we all should be using that by default.


&gt;<i> I have in the past omitted these sugar type details 
</I>
I did not talk about sugar type details (plural) that can be omitted.
The &quot;const&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; are not sugar! The detail (singular) that can (and
usually should) be omitted is &quot;*&quot;.


&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> found that the compiler picked to use the object copy-assignment to
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate the object into the 'auto' variable. 
</I>
Yes, that is exactly what the compiler does: Whether you omit &quot;*&quot; or
not, the compiler must copy the object. Where &quot;*&quot; sugar is possible,
that object is the pointer.


&gt;<i> That may just have been
</I>&gt;<i> compiler bugs, but is a nasty one anyway. So I prefer to only replace
</I>&gt;<i> the type name with auto to ensure that implicit conversions are kept to
</I>&gt;<i> minimal or performant ones and the nature of the variable remains
</I>&gt;<i> visible to us reading it.
</I>
The nature of a pointer is its methods/operators, not &quot;*&quot; in its type
declaration. Otherwise, smart pointers would not be pointers. When you
add &quot;*&quot; to auto, you tell the reader that the variable cannot be a smart
pointer. Usually, that is not what you want to tell or enforce.


HTH,

Alex.
