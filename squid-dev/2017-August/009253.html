If I am not wrong this is prevented by ntlm/UserRequest.cc code.

The ntlm/* code for each new connection:
    1) expects a type1 message in Authorization header (and send a YR 
request to helper)
    2) sends back to the client a type2 message in WWW-Authenticate header
    3) expects a type3 message in Authorization header (and send a KK 
request to helper)

If squid did not receive with that order the authentication info from 
the client will just reject/deny the connection.

The ntlm helpers designed to be idiots. They expect a YR and then a KK. 
Every new YR resets their state.
They are not responsible to check for more and must not do it.

Squid code is responsible for this, and I believe this patch does not 
break anything in this area: Any expired reservation results to close 
client connection.
A any new connection still have to repeat the 3  NTLM authentication 
steps to authenticate.

Am I missing something?

&gt;<i> reservation state. The victim client generates the YR, then after 
</I>&gt;<i> timeout the attacker supplies the KK. The TT goes out on one TCP 
</I>&gt;<i> connection, and the KK returns via a different one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. also note that this is only an issue for NTLM. However the existence 
</I>&gt;<i> of Negotiate/NTLM flavour of Negotiate makes that interface hit the same 
</I>&gt;<i> problem at times. This whole reservation thing is irrelevant with Kerberos.
