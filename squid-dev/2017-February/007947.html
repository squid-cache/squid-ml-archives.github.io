I probably should have been more explicit here. Please rename the new
Security::CreateClientSession() and friends to
Security::CreateClientConnection() and such. If the patch adds other
sessions that are actually SSL connections, please fix them as well.

There is also misnamed Security::SessionPointer but this patch does not
introduce that bug so I cannot ask you to fix it in this patch. It
should be renamed to Security::Connection in a separate commit.


FWIW, I am not married to the word &quot;Connection&quot; in this context. It is
possible that another (less overloaded in other contexts) word would
work here, but

* &quot;Connection&quot; is technically correct
* I cannot think of a better word (and we use it in other projects)
* &quot;Session&quot; is very wrong because it already names another SSL concept.


Thank you,

Alex.
