I agree that there are many problems related to Via adding code and that
fixing those problems will improve addVia(), but I see no reasons to
call the proposed patch premature or insist that some other fixes should
be done first. The patch does not obscure anything or make anything
worse IMO; quite the opposite!

I responded because it is wrong to request out of scope changes when
reviewing a harmless de-duplication patch. Yes, a reviewer can always
suggest further improvements, but when there is nothing wrong with the
patch, such suggestions should be explicitly stated as optional future
work, not patch polishing/fixing requests.


As for the patch itself, I am not going to waste more of your time on
this, especially if you are going to fix all those other bugs. Do
whatever you think is best. Hopefully, it is possible to do that without
belittling or blocking bug fixes by others, no matter how small.


Thank you,

Alex.
