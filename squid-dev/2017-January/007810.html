Thank you.

In Ssl::ClientBio::stateChanged:

* please make the initial comment:
   // detect client-initiated renegotiation DoS (CVE-2011-1473)

* The counting logic does not seem right:

&gt;<i> +        const time_t currentTime = getCurrentTime();
</I>&gt;<i> +        if (windowRenegotiationsStart + RenegotiationsWindow &lt; currentTime) {
</I>&gt;<i> +            windowRenegotiationsStart = currentTime;
</I>&gt;<i> +            windowRenegotiations = 1;
</I>&gt;<i> +        } else {
</I>
... each attempt, the start timer is moved forward to the current
timestamp. So you are not counting 5 per 10sec, you are rejecing is
&gt;<i>10sec between attempts (which is okay I think, but still not what is
</I>intended).

I think the FadingCounter class should be used here instead.
