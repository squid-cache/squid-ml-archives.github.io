Great. I have no objections to a commit then.

I suggest replacing the &quot;client-sent ClientHello must be available for
peek&quot; comment with &quot;we should not be here if we failed to parse the
client-sent ClientHello&quot; to clarify, but this is obviously minor.


&gt;<i> Now Squid peeks (or stares) at the origin server as configured, even if it
</I>&gt;<i> does not fully support the client SSL/TLS record/message.
</I>
Perhaps the vagueness of that &quot;does not fully support&quot; phrase drives
some of my questions. Initially, I probably thought that Squid cannot
even parse a TLS Hello in an SSLv2 record. And that failure to parse
triggered the wrong code path in ServerBio::write().

Now I think that we actually parse it just fine and the buggy code was
just too aggressive in reacting to the wrong version (which was already
flagged by the &quot;Should we allow it for all protocols?&quot; comment).

If we ever get to step3, OpenSSL may not be able to successfully
negotiate an SSL connection with a client that is using SSLv2 records.
That potential bumping failure during step3 is not a problem we are
solving here, and it is not a problem in pure peek-and-splice setups
because they do not normally bump and, hence, never ask OpenSSL to
negotiate using SSLv2 records.

Please correct my understanding or detail the commit message a little to
confirm it. For example, we could say &quot;Now Squid peeks (or stares) at
the origin server as configured, even after detecting (and parsing)
SSLv2 records&quot;.


Thank you,

Alex.
