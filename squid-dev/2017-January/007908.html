</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry it has taken me so long to respond on this. I wanted to verify the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of realm in the H(A1) digest. Why it was marked as REQUIRED
</I>&gt;<i> to begin with.
</I>No, thank you to have taken the time.
&gt;<i> Sadly I have to report my suspicion was correct and I vote -1 on this in
</I>&gt;<i> its current form. BUT I can think of two ways to get around it, see end
</I>&gt;<i> of this mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problems are that;
</I>&gt;<i>   1) the realm is both the salting value used within the hash and the
</I>&gt;<i> scope limitation on what inputs from HTTP are used to compare against
</I>&gt;<i> the A1, and
</I>&gt;<i>   2) Squid does not itself verify the realm received was the one offered
</I>&gt;<i> and leaves the comparison to the backend system. There is some
</I>&gt;<i> possibility the authentication system is using multiple security realms
</I>&gt;<i> and Squids realm string is just an offer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not having realm tied to the credentials in the backend storage leaves
</I>&gt;<i> this particular helper with no other option but to trust the realm sent
</I>&gt;<i> (probably) over clear-text by any client/attacker actually matches the
</I>&gt;<i> salting. That allows remote senders to manipulate the realm string they
</I>&gt;<i> send to perform a collision attack against the stored password.
</I>&gt;<i>   They no longer have to find and prove knowledge of the password. But
</I>&gt;<i> just find a collision for its hash vs arbitrary realm strings.
</I>Ok point taken.

&gt;<i> Old Digest systems are not the safest things to begin with. They also
</I>&gt;<i> tend to use MD5 hashing which was the only one available for many years
</I>&gt;<i> and relatively easy to find collisions for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Workaround #1:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there just one (or a few) realm that all your stored passwords use?
</I>Yes only one, as we lost the ability to iterate over multi-valued entry 
using the realm as a key.
&gt;<i> I think we can accept the absence of realm per-password if there were a
</I>&gt;<i> global realm to check against instead. A command line option could be
</I>&gt;<i> added to pass an explicit realm (or multiple?) which the helper can use
</I>&gt;<i> to reject the possible attacks.
</I>Ok, so a rework of the patch with a mandatory command line option to 
specify the realm in case of null delimiter will be acceptable ?
I think that &quot;an explicit realm&quot; is sufficient. To have multiple realm, 
something like  realm:HA1 must already be in place or is really 
completely broken by design.
Mono &quot;hard-coded in conf&quot; realm is not flexible but not broken -&gt; I know 
a lots of such setup. That is what I would like to address.
I don't know any real setup which need the &quot;multiple possible implicit 
realm in conf&quot; way
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Workaround #2:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Emmanuel;  are you able to easily implement a LDAP field that adds a
</I>&gt;<i> second 'realm:password' value to the LDAP for this helper to check for
</I>&gt;<i> without changes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is probably the best approach long-term. AFAIK realm:HA1 is a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly standard format for modern Digest systems so it may be neeed
</I>&gt;<i> anyway for other software than Squid.
</I>Yes, this is the best approach, but I have no control on the downstream 
LDAPs. The problem is reported to the customer(s) but I could not 
&quot;force&quot; them to migrate quickly as we talk about big installations (8k 
to 80k users or more) with lots of specific in house applications using 
the same LDAP servers.

Emmanuel.
