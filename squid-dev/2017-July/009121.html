<PRE>Hello,

    The Squid Project will be transitioning its official source code
repository from bzr to git. Most of the currently stored official
information will be preserved during the migration. The lists of all bzr
branches and tags to be migrated or abandoned are available[1,2]. If you
find any problems with those lists, please speak up ASAP. For technical
details about the official migration process, see [3,4].

If you are a developer with unofficial bzr branches, you may use the
standard export/import procedure[5] or the experimental bzr2git4notes
tool[4] for migrating your repository. Please practice on toy projects
first and validate the final results because lossless migration is far
from trivial. If you have many branches and do not want to migrate all
of them at once, then please make sure you keep state files used during
earlier migration steps. If those files are lost, it may be a lot more
difficult to import additional bzr branches later, especially if you
want to preserve bzr annotations like bzr2git4notes does.

The migration is expected to take less than 36 hours but unforeseen
problems may extend it for several days. Once the migration starts,
there should be no official bzr commits. After the migration, any
official commits will be pushed into the git repository on Github.

The transition schedule below is meant to minimize inconveniences for
Squid committers. If you are a committer, and the schedule below does
not work well enough for you, please email me.

  2017-07-11: No more new tags in the official bzr repo.
  2017-07-13: No more new commits(*) in the official bzr repo.
  2017-07-14: Migration starts.
  2017-07-15: Anticipated optimistic migration end.
  2017-07-18: Anticipated pessimistic migration end.

All times are noon UTC.

Once the repository is migrated to git and uploaded to Github, I will
post another email to reopen official commits (pushed into the Github
repository). There are no changes in review and official code acceptance
procedures at this time (but we continue to work on automating pull
request tests).

Thank you,

Alex.
P.S. (*) Short-term post-migration needs (such as release maintenance)
may require some bzr commits and/or tags after the cutoff date, but any
such bzr commits/tags will have unofficial/housekeeping status.
