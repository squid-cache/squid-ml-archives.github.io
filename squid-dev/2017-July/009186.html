I did not mean to hint at any known problem: When doing something new,
like a new commit process, one is likely to run into some yet-unknown
problems, and it would be nice to trouble shoot them in a simpler
environment.

The first such problem surfaced today: The &quot;require Code Owners review&quot;
option blocked PRs because Squid has no Code Owners, as defined by
Github[1]. I unchecked that option.

[1] <A HREF="https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners">https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners</A>

</I>&gt;<i> automatic reviewer vote for/against commit - not as automatic acceptance

</I>
Your summary matches my expectations. Master commits will be automated
as well, but that is a separate step/problem, not directly related to CI.

&gt;<i> Github: Merging can be performed automatically once the requested
</I>&gt;<i> changes are addressed.
</I>
Please note that Github definition of &quot;automation&quot; appears to be
different from mine in this context. AFAICT, Github considers manual
commits done via its web interface &quot;automation&quot;. I do not.


BTW, while Eduard is working on proper Jenkins integration, I have
enabled a basic &quot;./bootstrap.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
distcheck&quot; test via Semaphore CI. You can see Github waiting for that
test in your PR now... If you want to see the other side, I think you
need to create a personal Semaphore CI account so that I can add you to
the Squid Organization there.

The CI check for your PR is probably stuck because the PR code has not
been updated since CI testing was enabled. I tried to tickle Semaphore
but failed, and added a comment about it to your PR. I know a similar
check worked OK (eventually) for a _new_ PR that I did on a forked Squid
repository before migrating the setup to the Squid project.


Cheers,

Alex.
