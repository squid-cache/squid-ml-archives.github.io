Wrong audience, I suppose.


&gt;<i> The tools I have right now are a bunch of scripts that maintain a

</I>&gt;<i> and if it is a backport the revision/patch ID in the branch where it
</I>&gt;<i> originated.
</I>
If you prefer, the above can be done using PR labels. For example, some
projects use a pair of labels for each backporting target X:

* X-nominated -- somebody wants this PR ported to X; it is not in X
* X-accepted -- maintainer supports the nomination

The four combinations of the above two labels reflect all possible
states of the PR with regard to porting to version X (e.g., a lonely
X-accepted means the PR was ported). Github search can be used to find
PRs to backport.

If you need to remember which non-nominated PRs should not be nominated,
you need another label to mark those (e.g., maintainer-processed).


&gt;<i> group other revisions/patches as delayed fixes to the primary commit.
</I>
This important requirement cannot be supported using PR labels. If you
prefer, you can maintain a (specially formatted) Github comment in a
merged PR that accumulates delayed fixes. This will place all
information about the PR in one place.

Needless to say, it is possible to automatically find to-be-ported PRs
and form changesets. Github has an API for querying PRs.


I have no idea whether the above Github hacks are overall better than
what you already have and whether there are better hacks/tooling I do
not know about.

Alex.
