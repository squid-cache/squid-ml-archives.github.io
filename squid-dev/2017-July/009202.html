<PRE>Well, what I was thinking is that issues in github cab mainly be related to coding and development like what the squid-dev list is.
I understand that technically the Bugzilla and the issues section are not different too much, but, we can logically set a rule that issues would be in the Squid-Cache project for development related conversations only.

I believe that the much younger programmers are already registered to github so it would make sense to use the github issues for these.
I mean: If I(a programmer) already have an account at github, why should I open a new account just to start interacting with the Squid-Cache project?
So disabling it completely is good for certain purposes but if the project would have a nice README.md with couple guide lines such as:
- To report security vulnerabilities use XYZ
- To make first contact with the development team use the issues section.
- ....

Once we decide on the right approach I believe we can start and see what pop in the &quot;issues net&quot;, maybe it's worth leaving it open just for the sake of &quot;solicitation&quot;.
(Solicitation these days reminds me of a bug in Golang which prints
&quot;Unsolicited response received on idle HTTP channel...&quot;
<A HREF="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12855">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12855</A> 
One of their biggest bugs I have seen that were not handled for a very long time and is relevant specifically to http proxies which uses the native http libs )

What do you think about the idea of leaving the issues section open? Or maybe we are not looking for such audience?

AFAIK no. We can restrict certain issue updates (e.g., comment editing) but not issue reading and issue creation.


&gt;<i> I believe that the right place to have a &quot;TODO&quot; or similar notes as a github issue might be a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the Bugzilla has much to offer then github issues so +1 for staying with the Bugzilla, but maybe try to utilize issues for code specific things and to allow only specific users get access to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What is the essential difference between a code-specific TODO/note and a feature request that makes only the former category benefit from using Github Issues?

Alex.
