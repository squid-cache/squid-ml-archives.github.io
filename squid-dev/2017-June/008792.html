</I>

&gt;&gt;<i>  - the important comment by Duane in src/main.cc SquidShutdown() is now

</I>
&gt;<i> Since I am refusing to remove debug_log in this patch, the comment does
</I>&gt;<i> not need updating. The comment itself should be removed as stale (or
</I>&gt;<i> completely rewritten) because (a) Squid provides several services that

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;close&quot; API so that we do not need to warn anybody not to use that wrong
</I>&gt;<i> API.
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i> in src/debug.cc:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * debugOpenLog()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - since the bulk of the function is being altered please take the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity to remove the use of NULL in there.
</I>
&gt;<i> I am not going to do what I think is wrong and what I continue to
</I>&gt;<i> discourage others from doing. The pain reduction rule we all should
</I>&gt;<i> follow IMO is &quot;If you do not have to change a line for in-scope reasons,
</I>&gt;<i> then do not change that line&quot;.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>  - in the else condition after fopen() we are writing explicitly to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stderr then clearing TheLog. It seems to me that a better thing would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do is write that notice to TheLog before clearing it, to perror() and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then to TheLog after clearing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TheLog is usually closed at the time of that &quot;else&quot; code execution. The
</I>&gt;<i> correct solution here is to use debugs(), while making sure that API
</I>&gt;<i> works in this (and nearly any other) context and logs to stderr and
</I>&gt;<i> syslog as needed. That change is outside this patch scope.

&gt;<i> Did I convince you that none of the above requested changes are required?

Amos, are you OK with this patch going in &quot;as is&quot; for the reasons given
above? If not, please see if those reasons have affected any of your
change requests so that we can make progress.


Thank you,

Alex.
