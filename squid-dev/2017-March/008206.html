##END OF PAGE

When I am removing the cache_peer line the file is being fetched.
I am not sure what should have happen and what went wrong.
This is a part of a test I am running to vetify  how would a clustered set
of squid will work with a load balancer infront of them and also to verify
how would the proxies would communicate via ICP and HTCP.
The cache proxy are using a glusterfs nfs mount and rock cache_dir.
In theory and by glusterfs benchmarks(I ran) the proxy should be able to
read faster over the glusterfs and in speeds above 10Gbps.
There is a split of a second theoretical slow down but in practice I have
yet to feel it on small scale.

I need your help to understand if this is a bug and if so what should be
done with it.
