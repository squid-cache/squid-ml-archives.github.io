I would disagree with you on these accounts and with Mayers (if that is
actually his position) auto has its place and that place is generally
when dealing with templates, and especially in templates where types are
not fixed in the definition. So auto simplifies boilerplate. It's a very
good feature.

Sure, you are more than welcome to replace every instance of type with
auto, but don't be very surprised when few weeks from now you are
looking at a piece of code and want to know what structure something
comes from and then tracing things through the code just because you
wanted to use auto instead of `Foo`.

But arguing this kind of reminds of trying to argue with someone that
for loops are not dead because you can now do everything with
std::algorithm and lambdas. It's not very productive.

C++ is a statically typed language and auto does not make that go away.

&gt;<i> In my personal experience, going against Sutter and Mayers advice

</I>&gt;<i> is usually much easier to fix their wrongs than mine. (Just like with
</I>&gt;<i> Squid or any other development, it is often about making good mistakes

</I>
Let's just say just because someone is famous and knows a few things
does not imply others don't know things. I've learned on my own skin
that hiding types can cause serious problems, but maybe it's just me.

Cheers,
Adam
