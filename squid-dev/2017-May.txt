Thank you for working on this.


Is there an explicit need you have found for ALE to be on the component 
list?
Since ALE is currently standing in as a "master transaction" object for 
most of the Squid code. It needs to be either created or 
provided/fetched from elsewhere whenever it is used. Having an ACL that 
bypasses that would defeat bug-finding of places where it is broken.

We don't need to solve the general case. We need to solve the handful of 
actual uses in Squid code, then add the risky function to the forbidden 
list which is enforced by sourcemaintenance.sh.

strdup != strndup.

For strdup() replacement we absolutely can do strlen(). It requires 
nul-termination explicitly.

The xstrndup(F.c_str(), ...) pattern appears exactly once. In this 
exception handler under discussion.

My question was about that one use-case you highlighted as example, not 
the general solution. It appears to me that while there is some 
variation caused by the message contents being filename and line numbers 
- they are still short enough that over-allocation is not a huge problem 
and whatever exception handler catches this will end with deallocation 
quite quickly.

The relevant lines being these:
  src/sbuf/Exceptions.cc:    SBuf explanatoryText("OutOfBoundsException");
  src/sbuf/Exceptions.cc:        explanatoryText.appendf(" at line %d", 
aLineNo);
  src/sbuf/Exceptions.cc:        explanatoryText.appendf(" in file %s", 
aFileName);
  src/sbuf/Exceptions.cc:    explanatoryText.appendf(" while accessing 
position %d in a SBuf long %d",
  src/sbuf/Exceptions.cc:    message = 
xstrndup(explanatoryText.c_str(),explanatoryText.length());

Over-allocation appears to only be possible if/when the aFileName 
contains null characters internally. Then rawContent() instead of 
c_str() drops the extra allocation.

xstrncpy() still halts on the input \0 character if it happens early 
regardless of whether c_str() or rawContent() is used to supply the 
input. And passing it length()+1 safely handles non-terminated input 
without an length()+1 byte allocated because xstrncpy ends on the n'th 
byte for terminating *dst instead of copying it from input.


PS. appendf() is probably causing a re-allocation as well to grow the 
MemBlob. So we are looking at probably three allocations here. If this 
exception handler is stable enough now to be worth optimizing we should 
probably also look at ways to reserve enough memory for explanatoryText 
before putting anything into it.

I would like to polish that question and correct its justification
logic: We can abuse admins as bug-finding guinea pigs only if we give
them tools to turn those bugs off. The "has" ACL is such a tool. Thus,
we need a "has" ACL component for any object that any ACL or ACL-driven
code uses (or should be using) conditionally. Hence, the question is:

Does Squid ACL or ACL-driven code correctly use (or should be using) ALE
conditionally?

If the answer is "yes", then ALE should be added to "has". If the answer
is "maybe", then ALE may be added to "has".

Please note that it is not necessary to have a specific crash or warning
bug report for the answer to become "yes" or "maybe", justifying ALE
support in the "has" ACL. Squid code analysis is sufficient.

I cannot answer that question without doing more research, but I am sure
Eduard can find the right answer.


Thank you,

Alex.

By "general", I meant "an average or typical use case in Squid code".
Some callers can probably allocate correctly for themselves, but some
cannot (or will break after surrounding code changes). The need for
strndup() is genuine and will remain for the foreseeable future.

I know. I meant exactly what I said -- "strdup" (and "If").

I know. I believe I have answered your question -- yes, we can xmalloc()
and strncpy() in that case, but we do not want to do that.

And it was not highlighted as an "example". I mentioned it (in P.S.!)
only because the current fix there looks wrong and is slow. I wanted to
avoid a discussion of why I could not write a more efficient code there.
I naturally regret mentioning that at all now!

Agreed. We should not do xmalloc+strncpy there because we should not
replace a clear high-level code with risky low-level manipulations on an
error handling path. Overallocation is not a problem in this case.


> If this exception handler is stable enough now to be worth optimizing 

OT: In general, exception handlers performance is not a primary concern
because exceptions should not be used for something that is expected to
happen very often on a performance-sensitive path.

Alex.

As I noted before, after r14752 each transaction(even a failed one,
see logAcceptError()) has its ALE created. Normally it is stored in
ClientHttpRequest::al.  However, I see that many ACLFilledChecklist
objects does not initialize their ACLFilledChecklist::al (assigning from
the transaction ALE). That works for now in most cases, probably
because there is the only ACLExternal which needs it and overrides
requiresAle() to return true. On the other hand, the lack of proper
ACLFilledChecklist::al initialization makes impossible correct using
ALE component in our 'has' ACL.

Evidently, if we fix this (e.g., with mandatory initializing
ACLFilledChecklist::al in its constructor), we would not need to
check ALE component either.

When you say "each transaction", how do you define "transaction" in this
context?

AFAICT, r14752 deals with transactions originated by client requests and
broken client connections. Even if all those transactions are fully
covered, there are other transactions (e.g., ESI and Downloader
requests) that may or may not be covered (and seem to be completely
unrelated to r14752 changes!). Is there some kind of common interface
that essentially requires all transactions to have ALE now?

Thank you for researching this. Does the following summary accurately
reflect your findings as far as the current code is concerned?

"The current ACL-driven code may feed an ACLFilledChecklist object
without ALE to an (ACLExternal) ACL that requires ALE."


> Evidently, if we fix this (e.g., with mandatory initializing
> ACLFilledChecklist::al in its constructor), we would not need to
> check ALE component either.

The question is whether we can "fix this" (i.e., guarantee correct ALE
presence when ALE is needed) _quickly_. I doubt that all
ACLFilledChecklist objects can easily reach the right ALE from their
constructing context. I am worried that fixing this will turn into a
serious, large project. Are you sure it will not?

If you are not sure, then I suggest keeping "has ALE" support. We can
easily make "has ALE" a no-op when/if the code is fixed to always have
access to ALE when ALE is needed.

I see no reason to resist supporting "has ALE" if Squid support for ALE
is currently broken and cannot be fixed easily/quickly. If you see flaws
in this logic, please point them out. I may be missing something.


Thank you,

Alex.

I have not found any ALE manipulations inside ESI and Downloader
code, so that is probably unrelated.
ClientHttpRequest is the object used in transactions, (including
Downloader and ESI code). This object owns its ALE, which is
created in the constructor. I have not found 'common interface'
you are talking about, but if all Squid transactions require
ClientHttpRequest object (which is probably true) then they surely
will have the corresponding ALE.

As I tried to explain earlier, how can we rely on
ACLFilledChecklist::hasAle(), if the ALE itself have not been provided to
ACLFilledChecklist before?

N.B. The discussion from here until the "----" marker is probably
unimportant because you later seem to confirm that "has ALE" is needed.
I am preserving this discussion in case I misjudged your confirmation
and/or in case this discussion will help resolve the remaining confusion
(after the marker).

Not sure I understand. Are you implying that Squid-initiated
transactions can never evaluate an ACL that requires ALE? Consider a
Downloader job that initiates a transaction which attempts to access
Squid cache, evaluating various caching directives, some of which may
use an external ACL that needs an ALE. If that code does not give
FilledChecklist an ALE, the admin will see warnings that "has ALE" is
meant to work around.

(The Downloader is used above as an example of a Squid-initiated
transaction -- I am not claiming that Downloader lacks ALE; based on
your research it does have ALE. This example illustrates that
transaction initiator code does not need to explicitly manipulate ALE to
trigger ALE-related ACL checks down the road).


> ClientHttpRequest is the object used in transactions,

Do all transactions (that may use ACLs) create a corresponding
ClientHttpRequest object? Downloader does. I do not think ESI does; it
seems to keep a link to the HTTP ClientHttpRequest object but I do not
know how that is used when it comes to ESI-triggered ACL checks. There
are also ICP/HTCP transactions, eCAP/ICAP transactions, netdb exchanges,
and Cache Digest transactions. There may be others. At least some of
them use ACLs or trigger ACLs use elsewhere.

Why do you think it is probably true? What makes ClientHttpRequest
required for any code that might use ACLs?


> then they surely will have the corresponding ALE.

Even if that is true, "having" ALE and "supplying every FilledChecklist
with ALE" are two different things, right? Can we be sure that all that
code configures FilledChecklist with ALE?

To avoid misunderstanding, these are genuine questions -- I really do
not know the answers. I want to drop "has ALE" support, but you have not
convinced me that we can do that right now.

OK, so you confirm that there is a problem and the remaining question is
whether we can fix it quickly (and drop "has ALE").

OK, so we keep "has ALE".

I do not understand your concern. If ALE has not been provided to
ACLFilledChecklist, then ACLFilledChecklist::hasAle() returns false and
our "has ALE" ACL does not match, allowing the admin to avoid the
warning about the missing ALE while making sure her ACL-driven
directives do what they are supposed to do, even though there is no ALE.
Is not that exactly what we want? What "breakage" do you anticipate with
"has ALE"?

For example, before/without "has ALE", the following directive might
produce numerous warnings and wrong Squid behavior in environments where
Squid evaluates store_miss for transactions that did not supply ALE to
FilledChecklist:

    store_miss deny foo

With "has ALE" in her toolbox, the admin can work around the problem:

    # option 1: store misses when ALE is missing
    store_miss allow !hasAle
    store_miss deny foo

    # option 2: do not store misses when ALE is missing
    store_miss deny !hasAle
    store_miss deny foo

(the choice is up to the admin -- we do not know what is the right
workaround in her environment)


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] A new 'has' ACL
Message-ID: <69d624f9-f6bf-ebcd-9cfa-22622703550b@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch implements a new 'has' ACL.

This ACL detects presence of request, response or ALE transaction
components.

The feature specification and related discussion can be found at:

http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2017-May/008559.html


Regards,

Eduard.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Fix 'miss_access' and 'cache' checks when no
 ACL rules matched
Message-ID: <75437f06-dc80-4ca8-510e-69fc815962e3@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch fixes "miss_access" and "cache" checks when no ACL rules
matched.

The miss_access code allowed transactions to reach origin server when no
"allow" rules matched (and no "deny" rule matched either). This could
happen when a miss_access directive ACL could not make a "match" or
"mismatch" decision (e.g., the admin used a slow ACL or an ACL that
required authentication when the user was not authenticated).

Similarly, the "cache" directive code allowed requests to be served from
the cache (and responses to be stored in the cache) when no "allow" (and
"deny") rules matched. This behavior (established in v5 r14984) does not
contradict "Requests denied by this directive will not be..."
documentation, though.

I believe that both "miss_access" and "cache" directives should behave
like all other directives in similar contexts, i.e., "deny" in such
indeterminate cases because:

* It avoids problems with configurations like:

    # broken if badGuys fails to match or mismatch (allows bad guys)
    acl_driven_option allow !badGuys

   That is what trunk r12176 has partially fixed.

* It makes ACL checking rules consistent with each other, especially if
   there is no good reason for making exception for these two cases.

To help avoid similar problems in the future, and to improve code
consistency, I added an API that eliminates the need for direct
comparison with ACCESS_ALLOWED and ACCESS_DENIED.

Thanks,

Eduard.

I think we can simplify that comment while making it more precise:

    peerProbeConnect(p); // detect any died or revived peers ASAP

The (void) cast was correct, but is no longer needed after v5 r15133.

The above are minor polishing touches that could be done during commit,
but I am writing this message because I think we may be able to cover
one more corner case without significant changes...

Imagine a situation where the peers are already being probed during
peerDNSConfigure(). Patches Squid will do nothing nothing in this case.
However, the current probes may be using old/wrong IP addresses (or
other peer configuration parameters) and, hence, may produce wrong
result. This lack of a fresh probe may delay the discovery of a died or
revived peer and might even cause an HTTP transaction failure (in the
"the peer has recently died" case).

On the other hand, we still do not want to create too many concurrent or
too frequent probes so we want to continue to honor the current
peerProbeConnect() concurrency and rate limits.

Please see if the following small change allows Squid to handle the
above case better:

1. Add a boolean CachePeer::reprobe field, defaulted to false. It can be
described as "whether to do another TCP probe after the current TCP probes".

2. peerProbeConnect() should clear the reprobe field after passing the
two if-statement guards and before entering the loop (even if there are
no IPs to probe). The right timing here would eliminate any implicit
reprobing loops while providing the desired functionality.

3. After closing the connection, peerProbeConnectDone() should call
peerProbeConnect() if reprobe is true.

4. Add a boolean reprobeIfBusy parameter to peerProbeConnect() with
false as the default value. peerDNSConfigure() will call
peerProbeConnect() with a true parameter value. peerProbeConnect() will
start by setting reprobe to (reprobe || reprobeIfBusy).

There may be more initialization/reporting/cloning steps needed, just
like for any other CachePeer data member, but the above reflects the
core logic. Adjust as needed, of course.


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Make PID file check/creation atomic
Message-ID: <4f979ba8-1da9-d706-0646-fcd6a391dd4c@measurement-factory.com>

This patch makes PID file check/creation atomic to avoid associated
race conditions.

Authors: Alex Rousskov, Eduard Bagdasaryan

After this change, if N Squid instances are concurrently started shortly
after time TS, then exactly one Squid instance (X) will run (and have
the corresponding PID file). If another Squid instance has already been
running (with the corresponding PID file) at TS, then X will be that
"old" Squid instance. If no Squid instances were running at TS, then X
will be one of those new N Squids started after TS.

Lack of atomic PID file operations caused unexpected Squid behavior:
* Mismatch between started Squid instance and stored PID file.
* Unexpected crashes due to failed allocation of shared resources,
   such as listening TCP ports or shared memory segments.

A new File class guarantees atomic PID file operations using locks. We
tried to generalize/reuse Ssl::Lock from the certificate generation
helper, but that was a bad idea: Helpers cannot use a lot of Squid code
(e.g., debugs(), TextException, SBuf, and enter_suid()), and the old
Ssl::Lock class cannot support shared locking without a major rewrite.

File locks on Solaris cannot work well (see bug #4212 comment #14), but
those problems do not affect PID file management code. Solaris- and
Windows-specific File code has not been tested and may not build.

Failure to write a PID file is now fatal. It used to be fatal only when
Squid was started with the -C command line option. In the increasingly
SMP world, running without a PID file leads to difficult-to-triage
errors. An admin who does not care about PID files should disable them.

Squid now exits with a non-zero error code if another Squid is running.


Also removed PID file rewriting during reconfiguration in non-daemon
mode. Squid daemons do not support PID file reconfiguration since trunk
r13867, but that revision (accidentally?) left behind half-broken
reconfiguration code for non-daemon mode. Fixing that code is difficult,
and supporting PID reconfigure in non-daemons is probably unnecessary.

Also fixed "is Squid running?" check when kill(0) does not have
permissions to signal the other instance. This does happen when Squid is
started (e.g., on the command line) by a different user than the user
Squid normally runs as or, perhaps, when the other Squid instance enters
a privileged section at the time of the check (untested). The bug could
result in undelivered signals or multiple running Squid instances.

These changes do not alter partially broken enter/leave_suid() behavior
of main.cc. That old code will need to be fixed separately!

PID file-related cache.log messages have changed slightly to improve
consistency with other DBG_IMPORTANT messages and to simplify code.
Squid no longer lies about creating a non-configured PID file.


* Terminal errors should throw instead of calling exit()

Squid used to call exit() in many PID-related error cases. Using exit()
as an error handling mechanism creates several problems:

1. exit() does not unwind the stack, possibly executing atexit()
    handlers in the wrong (e.g., privileged) context, possibly leaving
    some RAII-controller resources in bad state, and complicating triage;
2. Using exit() complicates code by adding a yet another error handling
    mechanism to the (appropriate) exceptions and assertions.
3. Spreading exit() calls around the code obscures unreachable code
    areas, complicates unifying exit codes, and confuses code checkers.

Long-term, it is best to use exceptions for nearly all error handling.
Reaching that goal will take time, but we can and should move in that
direction: The adjusted SquidMainSafe() treats exceptions as fatal
errors, without dumping core or assuming that no exception can reach
SquidMainSafe() on purpose. This trivial-looking change significantly
simplified (and otherwise improved) PID-file handling code!


Thanks,
Eduard.

For the record, there is also an alternative way to avoid step2
adaptation (without using any annotations):

  adaptation_access request-modifier deny step2
  adaptation_access request-modifier allow all

Christos has verified that both approaches work so admins can pick the
one _they_ prefer (which may depend on, for example, whether they are
already using annotations for something else).

So the documentation of at_step is now wrong:
  "Never matches and should not be used outside of /ssl_bump/."

I suspect it was wrong from the very beginning, at least on the
conceptual level: That ACL should be usable during and after SslBump
steps. We may not support it in some contexts today, but the same can be
said of nearly every ACL. I suggest removing that documentation line or
at least replacing "ssl_bump" with "SslBump".


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Fix reopened bug 2833
Message-ID: <e09b57f9-9d26-b029-1719-4ea318d78083@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

This patch fixes [reopened] bug 2833.

A security fix made in r14979 had a negative effect on collapsed
forwarding. All "private" entries were considered automatically
non-shareable among collapsed clients. However this is not true: there
are many situations when collapsed forwarding should work despite of
"private" entry status: 304/5xx responses are good examples of that.
This patch fixes that by means of a new StoreEntry::shareableWhenPrivate
flag.

The suggested fix is not complete: to cover all possible situations we
need to decide whether StoreEntry::shareableWhenPrivate is true or not
for all contexts where StoreEntry::setPrivateKey() is used. This patch
fixes only few important cases inside http.cc, making CF (as well
collapsed revalidation) work for some [non-cacheable] response status
codes, including 3xx, 5xx and some others.

Also: avoid sending 304 responses for non-conditional requests.
Before this change, the original 'non-conditional' HttpRequest was still
marked (and processed) as 'conditional' after revalidation completion.
That happened because 'Last-Modified' and 'ETag' values were not
saved/restored while performing internal revalidation request.


Regards,

Eduard.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] fix escaping errors in manual pages causing
	information loss
Message-ID: <20170511172255.GE70982@athene.usta.de>

Hi,

while auditing manual pages in the OpenBSD ports tree, i noticed
serious escaping errors in four of the squid manuals that cause
information loss, in most cases loss of important information in
the SYNOPSIS.

The following patch against bazaar trunk fixes those issues.

Stuart Henderson, who is maintaining the OpenBSD port of squid,
advised that sending the patch to this list would be appropriate.


The reasons why the escaping is wrong are:

 1) In the roff language, \" introduces a comment,
    hence the rest of the input line is discarded by
    all formatters.

 2) In the roff language, \\ does *not* produce a printable
    backslash but merely delays expansion of the escape sequence
    (which is practically never what you want, unless you are
    programming a new macro package).  Consequently, "\\n'" ends
    up being interpreted as an access to the number register with
    the name "'" (yes, roff does allow identifiers consisting of
    special characters in some contexts), which doesn't exist and
    hence yields the output string "0".

Thanks for developing squid!

Yours,
  Ingo

P.S.
I'm not attempting to fix all manual page syntax errors that cause
misformatting (that would cause a very serious amount of work), but
only those that cause information loss.

Unlike most other directives these two the "deny" action is their 
primary purpose. Where most actions are about allowing things which are 
otherwise not done, these two are about denying things which normally 
are done. The allow action is merely a way to avoid following deny lines.

These both have a long history, and the cache directive in particular is 
kind of twisted and non-intuitive since its current behaviour was 
created to be backwards consistent with "no_cache allow" implying the 
Cache-Control:no-cache header existence.

The other access lists which obviously treat non-allowed as denied are 
very recent additions. So using them as a template to re-write existing 
and widely used directives behaviour is not great.


It is very likely that this change will cause installations previously 
"working" to have large amounts of traffic suddenly stop caching, or 
start getting 403 denials. That violates our intentions of not doing 
things to surprise admin if we can avoid it.

If we make this not-allowed == denied behaviour formal for how 
allow/deny/dunno tristate directives map to boolean. We should first 
make -k parse perform the "a fast-only directive uses a slow ACL!" 
check, and make the existing one an ERROR for a few releases.
  Also going through the process to deprecate cache directive formally 
might be worth beginning - most old uses should be a straight rename to 
store_miss, but some will be send_hit or a mix of the two. Just adding a 
debugs statement to that effect on startup, reconfigure, and -k parse 
should do for a while.

These parts I like. The allowed() method addition bits would be nice to 
apply however the behaviour change issues turn out.

Frankly speaking, the "cache" directive behavior changed rather
recently (r14984), as I noted above.  Can we say that it became 'widely' 
used
since then? On the contrary, I suspect that this change broke (or eventually
will break) some existing installations.
I so, the only "miss_access" directive check change may
break some installations.  Should we make an exception for this single
directive or formalize the rules, making them identical for all directives?
Probably the latter would be better for long term.  We can postpone this 
change
of course, adding a warning message for admin, that
'dunno' or 'auth required' outcomes will be denied in future releases.

That r14984 was itself carefully designed to _revert_ unintentional side 
effects hostVerify had on cache directive behaviour. Your patch is 
reverting those DUNNO occurances back to the code which had many, many 
complaints.

For cache there is the deprecation I mentioned.

For miss_access there is 
<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=528>, Squid-2 miss_access 
is a slow/async lookup.

If there are plans about deprecating 'cache' directive, good, but it is a
possibly a future work which is unrelated here.  BTW, I think we can't 
simply
'rename' it to 'store_miss' or a mix of the two directives because 'cache'
directive supports both fast and slow checks, but both 'store_miss' and
'send_hit' only fast ones.  Probably I miss or do_not_understand something
important.

I looked through bug 3940 discussion but have not found any connection 
between
ACCESS_DUNNO/ACCESS_AUTH_REQUIRED/checkNoCacheDone() and
hostHeaderVerify()/hostHeaderVerifyFailed() methods. Yes, all these methods
may change RequestFlags flags, and that what
fix of r14984 is about, but how, roughly, hostHeaderVerifyFailed() may cause
ACCESS_DUNNO? In other words, I have not found any hints about your primary
change ACCESS_ALLOWED into ACCESS_DENIED: no in the patch preamble, no
in the bug discussion. I assume there are another threads/bugs where 
this change
probably was discussed. If so, could you please post such references here?

There has been some confusion about what --helper-protocol parameters 
the Samba ntlm_auth helper needs when used with negotiate_wrapper helper.

This adds checks and warnings to the ensure the protocol used matches 
the --ntlm or --kerberos section.

I do not know enough about this area to properly review the patch so
please do not wait for my review.

FWIW, it looks like the changed code is still using strncasecmp() in
several places where strcasecmp() or even strcmp() should be used instead.


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Create PID file ASAP
Message-ID: <46a9a8c2-99f1-7824-7ef0-c8292fb24dfe@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,


With this fix applied, PID file is created right after configuration
finalization, before the allocation for any shared memory segments.

Late PID file creation allowed N+1 concurrent Squid instances to create
the same set of shared segments (overwriting each other segments),
resulting in extremely confusing havoc because the N instances would
later lose the race for the PID file (or some other critical resource)
creation and remove the segments. If that removal happened before a kid
of the single surviving instance started, that kid would fail to start
with open() errors in Segment.cc because the shared segment it tries to
open would be gone. Otherwise, that kid would fail to _restart_ after
any unrelated failures (possibly many days after the conflict), with
same errors, for the same reason.

Shared state corruption was also possible if different kids (of the
winning instance) opened (and started using) segments created (and
initialized) by different instances.

Situations with N+1 concurrent Squid instances are not uncommon because
many Squid service management scripts (or manual admin commands!)
* do not check whether another Squid is already running and/or
* incorrectly assume that "squid -z" does not daemonize.

This change finally makes starting N+1 Squid instances safe (AFAIK).

Also made daemonized and non-daemonized Squid create the PID file at the
same startup stage, reducing inconsistencies between the two modes.

This patch should be applied after applying PID file creation atomicity fix:
http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2017-May/008584.html


Regards,

Eduard.

The SBuf in dump() should be static locals for performance. Otherwise +1.

Looks reasonable to me, though I have not fully traced the differences 
in SUID scope most of them seems to be increases to what runs as 
low-privileged user.

I do not see any use of atomic's in this patch. Please use std::atomic 
locks to ensure actually atomic operations on the file locks. Squid does 
have some child processes operating as threads so custom implementations 
that don't use real atomic's will fail under some circumstances.

Could you clarify, what are these processes that 'operate as threads'? 
AFAIK,
Squid spawns its children by fork() and execlp(), and each new process is a
common process with its own address space. As for atomicity, the OS itself
guarantees that only one process can have an exclusive file lock at a
given time. Where do you suggest to use std::atomic then?

I followed your plan with few adjustments and reattached the patch.
Since the new CachePeer::reprobe is a kind of 'helper' flag with
default value, I think no other initialization/reporting/cloning steps
needed (as for similar CachePeer::tcp_up).

I did this change a bit differently, making these static SBufs
ACLHasComponentData class const members so that I could
reuse them in two methods, instead of duplicating C strings.
Reattaching the patch.

Hello,

    The attached patch is the first in a short series of patches that
improve Squid support for the Happy Eyeballs principle. The motivation
for these patches has been discussed on the dns_wait_for_all thread:
http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2016-September/006831.html

With this change, Squid no longer waits for all request forwarding
destinations to be resolved. Instead, it uses each fully resolved
destination as soon as it is needed. More info is in the patch preamble.

The next planned step is to deliver A and AAAA answers to the peer
selection code independently and ASAP. When both changes are combined,
the FwdState/tunneling code will receive IPvX addresses without waiting
for IPvY addresses (and/or other destination names) to be resolved,
making user eyeballs happier and, hence, facilitating IPv6 deployments.


This patch also adds reporting of peer type when dumping Connection
info. I removed operator "<<" definition from Connection.h header
because we should not burden all Connection users with these low-level
(and performance-unrelated) details. I also removed associated comments
because they were partially misleading (or perhaps outdated) and
partially misplaced (Connection.h is not the right place to state basic
C++ operator overloading rules). If there are no objections, I will
commit this minor improvement separately.

No changes to FwdServer class but its declaration has been moved from
the PeerSelectState.h header to peer_select.cc because FwdServer is
unused by peerSelect() users.

No changes to peerCountMcastPeers functionality. I only documented the
abuse and marked the abused ps_state field with XXX to prevent future
abuses.


Cheers,

Alex.

NP: This is not implementing the Happy Eyeballs *algorithm* (it is an 
explicitly standardized algorithm name, not a principle). While it 
enables parallel lookup and use of different paths, the individual path 
IPs remain ordered such that dns_v4_first is still relevant. "Happy 
Eyeballs" algorithm is specifically a DNS feature.

More correctly this code does not even begin to resolve some 
destinations until others are already started being connected to. It is 
a step back to non-deterministic forwarding timeouts.

*That* is the missing part of Happy Eyeballs. But as you note, is not 
included in this patch.

Audit:


in src/FwdState.cc:

* s/Will aborting forwarding/Will abort forwarding/


in src/peer_select.cc:

* psstate->lastError = NULL; // initiator owns the ErrorState object now
  - please use nullptr on moved or new lines

* The call to noteDestinationsEnd() with an error from peerSelectDnsResults() appears to abort *all* path connection attempts by the initiator with an error page if

  a) the first path had an error, or

  b) the DNS lookup for the path was slow enough that all previous paths
were tried and emptied from serverDestinations.

eg. for an IPv4-only network when the first N peers are unreachable (very fast TCP failover) and the Nth does not have
ipcache listed records (slow remote lookup).

Subject: [squid-dev] OpenSSL 1.1 regression
Message-ID: <4a8084a9-a38e-1a2e-4479-a3ab189fb4c3@treenet.co.nz>

Building Squid-5 r15136 against the latest libssl 1.1.0e on Ubuntu.

src/ssl/support.cc: In function ‘bool 
Ssl::verifySslCertificate(Security::ContextPointer&, const 
Ssl::CertificateProperties&)’:

src/ssl/support.cc:995:34: error: invalid use of incomplete type ‘struct 
ssl_ctx_st’
      X509 ***pCert = (X509 ***)ctx->cert;


Should I just update this hack code to use the 
X509_STORE_CTX_get0_cert() getter ?

or is this a sign of a deeper bug with the 
SQUID_USE_SSLGETCERTIFICATE_HACK autoconf test that needs to be fixed?

The main Squid binary is threaded via the DiskIO implementations (at the 
least). These threads may be operational at any time after the first 
StoreInit() call, and unfortunately do reach other parts of the startup 
logic.


An static std::atomic lock/flag around the File::File() try{...} 
internals to make it threadsafe should resolve any potential issues 
there, the fnctl locks should be able to cope with anything once the 
lock() method returns.

Thanks. I suspect the limitations you found to that class are behind the 
ssl_crtd helper bugs that keep coming up (eg multiple workers or helpers 
colliding on cert files). It should probably be converted to the new 
base/File class for better locking in the helper.

Those Ssl::Lock limitations are not bugs. The class does not support
shared locking, which is a limitation, but ssl_crtd code does not use
shared locking, so that limitation does not lead to ssl_crtd problems.
The primary reason we could not generalize Ssl::Lock is the helper
source code boundary that prohibits the use of most Squid code in
helpers (from debugging to TextException to enter_suid).

It is impossible to convert ssl_crtd to use File without either changing
the helper boundary policy or making that program into a Squid kid. The
conversion will not fix any known bugs, and all of that is outside this
project scope, but I believe we have already covered very similar issues
when discussing SBuf use in helpers a few months ago.

Note that all PID-related methods are invoked before mainInitialize():
creating PID file ASAP was our goal here. Also, PID file operation
is a separate activity which has nothing common with DiskIO. In other
words, since DiskIO code knows nothing about PID file, it can't do any
harm with it.
I think your suggestion may be valuable but only after somebody
starts using File class in a threaded environment.

The proposed patch contains changes necessary (but not sufficient!) to
implement a Happy Eyeballs algorithm.

It is both (and more!). The term "Happy Eyeballs" and RFC 6555 cover:

* a set of algorithm requirements (i.e., "principles" or "goals")
* an abstract algorithm that satisfies those requirements
* an example implementation of the algorithm in Chrome


> "Happy Eyeballs" algorithm is specifically a DNS feature.

The Happy Eyeballs algorithm is a combination of DNS and TCP (or other
transport-layer) actions. You might want to reread RFC 6555 if you think
that Happy Eyeballs is only (or even primarily) about DNS!

I do not think this is a "more correct" statement. I find it distracting
and misleading because the "started being connected to" is too vague to
be reliably interpreted in this context and, to be "correct", it has too
be interpreted at a such a low/literal level that it looses its relevance.

In hope to avoid wasting timing on perfecting vague terminology, here is
a realistic example with two destination domain names (A and B), each
having two IP addresses (v4 and v6), with IPv6 preferred. To illustrate
all possible steps, we consider the case where all HTTP transactions
fail. The patch essentially changes these sequential steps:

  1. Resolve A (getting A4 and A6 IPs).
  2. Resolve B (getting B4 and B6 IPs).
  3. Execute HTTP transaction with A6.
  4. Execute HTTP transaction with A4.
  5. Execute HTTP transaction with B6.
  6. Execute HTTP transaction with B4.

to these three groups of partially parallelized steps:

  1. Resolve A (getting A4 and A6 IPs).

  2. Resolve B (getting B4 and B6 IPs).
  3. Execute HTTP transaction with A6.

  4. Execute HTTP transaction with A4.
  5. Execute HTTP transaction with B6.
  6. Execute HTTP transaction with B4.

where steps 2 and 3 now run in parallel. In extreme cases where B
resolution is slower than HTTP transaction with A6, step 2 and step 4
now run in parallel as well!

Whether the first DNS byte resolving B will be written to the network
before or after the first TCP byte for A6 depends on many factors such
as HTTP persistent connection availability, slow ACLs, and I/O socket
readiness. Both step 2 and step 3 are not instantaneous actions but
relatively long activities with several asynchronous subtasks so it is
pointless to argue how to exactly define their "start" (or "finish")
time and whether step 2 will always "start" before 3. It is sufficient
to say that both will start shortly after step 1 and run in parallel.

Finally, we should eventually use asynchronous calls among the peer
selection code, the FwdState/tunnel jobs, and the DNS resolution code.
Some of those calls are already asynchronous, but I did not add more of
them in this patch, primarily because FwdState and TunnelStateData are
not AsyncJobs (and converting them to become AsyncJobs or equivalent is
a large out of scope project). When those asynchronous calls are in
place, even the first code statements of steps 2 and 3 will be
parallelized (to the extend such parallelization is possible in Squid).


> It is a step back to non-deterministic forwarding timeouts.

How do you define "non-deterministic forwarding timeouts"?

I do not think the patch increases the number of timed out transactions
in any significant or important way, but if it does, I would like to
learn about it and either fix the code or disclose the problem. I hope
the above specific example helps you withdraw this accusation.

> *That* is the missing part of Happy Eyeballs.

Yes, that too, and there is one more part not discussed in the preamble
because it is currently not planned as a part of this patch series. From
Squid point of view, Happy Eyeballs implementation needs at least four
distinct parts:

1. Squid currently implements: Use parallel A and AAAA queries.
2. This patch: ASAP delivery of IPs from peer selection to FwdState.
3. The next step: ASAP delivery of IPs from DNS to peer selection.
4. A separate project should add: Use parallel TCP connections.

(The above are very rough gists that identify critical Happy Eyeballs
features, not precise definitions of algorithms.)

Fixed.

Fixed.

The attached patch contains the above two fixes. No other changes.


> * The call to noteDestinationsEnd() with an error from

> by the initiator

When peerSelectDnsResults() is called with a non-nil error, there could
have been no connection attempts at all because a non-nil error means
that no paths have been found (i.e., psstate->foundPaths is zero). Here
is the corresponding calling code, with irrelevant lines removed:

    if (psstate->lastError && psstate->foundPaths)
        psstate->lastError = nullptr;

    initiator->noteDestinationsEnd(psstate->lastError);


Please correct me if I am wrong.


Thank you,

Alex.

No we can not use this function here.
But we can use the SSL_CTX_get0_certificate. But this is added after 
openssl-1.0.2 releases.

Looks that SQUID_USE_SSLGETCERTIFICATE_HACK autoconf test does not work 
well. The workaround used when the  SQUID_USE_SSLGETCERTIFICATE_HACK 
macro is false, which uses a termporary SSL object should work also.

I am not getting this compile error when I am trying to use 
openSSL-1.1.0, but I am getting a crash when squid is running and uses 
server-first bumping mode.
The crash is caused because the SQUID_USE_SSLGETCERTIFICATE_HACK is 
false and SQUID_SSLGETCERTIFICATE_BUGGY is true.

I am attaching a patch which fixes this bug for squid-5.

In my tests no, there is not need to be fixed.
Are you using an unmodified squid?

If it is possible to replace this version check with a ./configure-time
detection of SSL_CTX_get0_certificate() availability, please do that.
Avoiding OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER macros in new code may help with future
support for LibreSSL and/or other libraries that lie about OpenSSL API
version they provide.

Message-ID: <CAHsu8wobVvF+CXuneLsk68XS3TaHpGnT7DorJXX312hS1e+BOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am new to the Squid source and I am hoping for some advice about the
SslBump peek and splice code in PeerConnector.cc . I have about a
decade of commercial C++ experience although for the last 8 years or so
I've been using higher level languages. I have a reasonable amount of
experience related to network code and concepts.

Sorry for the essay length message .. thanks in advance to anyone who
reads it :)

BACKGROUND:

I been trying to set up a reliable transparent squid blacklist
enforcing proxy using an operating system vendor supplied version of
Squid, without decrypting client traffic. The Ubuntu squid package
isn’t linked against OpenSSL so I am playing with CentOS 7, which
provides Squid 3.5.20 with a few backported fixes.

I have a config that blocks based on matching SNI at SslBump step 2
and then splices at step3 having validated the server certificate. I
am currently assuming that when the server certificate is validated,
squid checks that the SNI server name received in step2 is actually
present in the certificate.

ssl_bump peek       step1
ssl_bump peek       step2 whitelist
ssl_bump terminate  step2 blacklist
ssl_bump peek       step2
ssl_bump splice     step3

This setup appeared to work, however when connecting to wikipedia.org
with Chrome I would sometimes see the following error:

kid1| Error negotiating SSL on FD 13: error:140920F8:SSL
routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown cipher returned (1/-1/0)

This is due to CHACHA20_POLY1305 being negotiated, which openssl on
CentOS 7 doesn’t recognise. This error prevents squid from further
validating the certificate or splicing the connection, even though use
of the cipher within squid isn't actually necessary for splicing.

As an experiment, I developed a patch for the Centos 7 Squid 3.5.20
source (attached) that prevents the usual error handling from
occurring when OpenSSL returns a SSL_R_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_RETURNED error.
This works in the sense that the splice is then successful, however
according to my tests it bypasses the usual server certificate
validation against certificate authorities.

MY QUESTIONS:

1. What is the impact of calling checkForPeekAndSplice() from
Ssl::PeerConnector::handleNegotiateError()? Particularly, in the case
that an ssl error of SSL_R_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_RETURNED is detected? I
found that by simply returning without calling this, the connection
stalled. I will admit that I don't know yet what
checkForPeekAndSplice() is doing or why it works.

2. Can anyone offer any advice on how server certificate validation
could proceed as normal after detecting (and ignoring) an unknown
cipher?

I have read elsewhere that this issue can be overcome by linking squid
against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL, however I would much rather put
together a solution that doesn’t stray too far from the supported
packages of an operating system vendor. I would also prefer to not
have to periodically deal with this each time a new cipher appears.

Cheers,
Dave

The above configuration looks strange but this is squid-dev not
squid-users, so I trust you have good reasons for terminating only at
step2 but also validating certificates (at step3). If not, you may want
to discuss your needs on squid-users.

That is correct. You are hitting a known limitation of the current
implementation -- step3 requires OpenSSL wire-level participation even
when splicing the connections. Squid v4 got rid of OpenSSL when
peeking/splicing during step2 (trunk r14670), but the same kind of
changes for splicing during step3 has not been sponsored.

FYI: Please use "universal" diff patches (diff options -U 30 and
--show-c-function). The Squid wiki has more instructions for developers.

IIRC, Ssl::PeerConnector::checkForPeekAndSplice() is the start of
SslBump step3. If your step2 action is not final, then you have to do
step3 or the transaction will stall.

I am not sure I understand the question, but

* pure certificate validation is unrelated to ciphers

* actual validation code (in Squid or the validation helper) may look at
ciphers as well (e.g., to reject weak ciphers [for some sites])


> I have read elsewhere that this issue can be overcome by linking squid

Squid does not support LibreSSL (well). You might be able to resolve the
issue by linking with a newer OpenSSL version, but I have not checked
whether that is actually true.

Your vendor is probably not fast enough compared with the rate of
SslBump changes (unfortunately).

... or some other aspect of TLS communication changes.

Do you need Squid to validate certificates? If yes, you can probably
hack your personal Squid along the lines of your initial patch OR
sponsor/wait for OpenSSL wire-level removal from the splicing pathway.
If not, you may be able to solve your problem by adjusting your Squid
configuration.


HTH,

Alex.

I found that applying a blacklist at step3 resulted in too many false positives
caused by subjectAltName matches. For example, the certificate for
www.bing.com also lists hosts related to their ad network, which meant that
applying an ad blocklist at step3 would also block www.bing.com. I realise
that blocking at step2 is flawed as bypassing the blacklist is as simple as
not including SNI in the request, however I am hoping separately to figure
out how to match missing SNI and terminate, either by acl config or a patch.

I just tested that sending a fake SNI causes certificate verification error,
which is great.

Or are you saying that the OpenSSL validation code could be used directly,
rather than having OpenSSL think it's doing a real handshake?

Sorry, i've attached an updated patch for any future discussion.

We set up a server with both ChaCha20 and a self signed cert, with my
patch, no validation was performed and the connection was spliced.

I tried the Fedora 26 alpha with Squid 4.0.11 and OpenSSL 1.1.0e, but had
the same unknown cipher issue.

Certificate validation is a killer feature and given that it almost works all of
the time, I think i'll try and come up with a patch that ignores the unknown
cipher whilst still validating the certificate.

Thanks for your help,
Dave

Factory is working on a patch to address that problem.

The above-mentioned patch might allow for matching missing SNIs as well
(as a side effect of other changes), but I am not sure. If it does not,
the infrastructure introduced by that patch would make it easier to
properly add such a feature. Or you can just hard-code a check in your
personal Squid, of course.

Yes, of course. For example, the "openssl verify" command line tool does
not do handshakes.

Alex.

Message-ID: <ae73aa8a-82a2-915a-1ca5-e17a263eeafd@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    While triaging a silent crash of a production Squid, I realized that
our death reporting code has a serious (and recently grown) hole. The
attached patch closes it. This reporting-only patch does not fix any
crashes. There are more technical details in the preamble.

Researching this problem gave me an idea on how we can preserve Squid
stack when dying from unhandled runtime exceptions. This patch does not
implement that idea but adds a corresponding XXX and TODO comments.

This patch changes the same SquidMainSafe() code as the pending atomic
PID patch does. While the changes conflict at the patch level, they are
fully compatible at the "logic level". The conflict is easy to resolve.


HTH,

Alex.
P.S. The "current exception" reporting code was copied, with
adaptations, from Web Polygraph. It uses a relatively well-known
"re-throw exception to determine its type" trick. There are several ways
to build a reporting API for exceptions. The proposed design worked the
best (after several trials and errors) in Polygraph.

GCC-6 went through another update for me today, and after 
re-bootstrapping the problem is gone. So I'm now thinking this may have 
been a fluke or timing mixup in my library juggling act between v5/v4 
and v3.5 builds.

Latest bzr checkout of Squid. But OpenSSL for me is ... well PITA is an 
understatement when it comes to Squid-3.5. I am beginning to think it 
was still setup for 3.5 when I built that v5.

I will see if it happens again and reevaluate the patch then.

Sorry for wasting time. :-(

For the t2 patch I am using the AC_CHECK_LIB autoconf macro to check for 
the function availability.

Agrr... Using the openSSL version was the faster/easier way. Touching 
autoconf may result to 2-3 full squid rebuilds to implement/test similar 
fixes.

there is not wasting time, because squid with server-first bumping mode

The autoconf detection part can be designed and tested with just 
bootstrap.sh and ./configure execution - then check what got set in 
includes/autoconf.h and config.log. No need for the "make" parts of 
building.

This bit seems to be correct.

Given the .cc file sequence of macro tests I think we can speed up 
./configure a bit by moving the use of 
SQUID_CHECK_OPENSSL_GETCERTIFICATE_WORKS into the if-not-found [] path.

eg.

AC_CHECK_LIB(ssl, SSL_CTX_get0_certificate, [
   AC_DEFINE(HAVE_SSL_CTX_GET0_CERTIFICATE, 1, [SSL_CTX_get0_certificate is available])
   ],[
   # check for bugs and hacks in the old OpenSSL API
   SQUID_CHECK_OPENSSL_GETCERTIFICATE_WORKS
   ])

Well. Of course this is what someone must do. But you have always to 
build and test, to avoid typo errors for example or other simple mistakes.
And after you are finished with this you are finding that it would be 
better to move a check into the if-not-found [] path to speed-up 
configure script!

The alternative is to convince others that Squid will not support
OpenSSL API implementations that lie about their OpenSSL API version.
Judging by the time wasted on related discussions about API basics, I
suspect it would be cheaper, in the long term, to use feature tests.

In general, using feature tests is also the cleaner and more
reliable way of dealing with API variations.

By definition, inspecting library version numbers only works

 - for one specific implementation:
   If somebody else does an alternative implementation, they have
   the choice of (1) not defining the foreign version number at all -
   which will result in catastrophic breakage in application
   software inspecting it - or (2) defining a very low number -
   which will result in such software not using available features -
   or (3) defining a very high number - which will result in such
   software to try and use unavailable features - or (4) slavishly
   follow the API development path of the older implementation,
   which defeats part of the purpose of an alternative implementation,
   because that precludes all of the following: earlier addition
   of good interfaces that the older implementation only added
   later; removal of dangerous interfaces that you don't want to
   support; postponing the addition of new interfaces added in the
   older implementation that you don't have the time yet to implement
   properly, or that you consider less important.

 - as long as that implementation does not change the API again:
   If they do change the API back later, you have to touch all your
   application code again and adjust all related version number
   checks.

So while checking version numbers may sometimes look like the easiest
and quickest way to get an issue out of the way, it is not very
sustainable in the long run, and avoiding it generally results in
better and more portable software, and in safer and ever easier
maintenance.

Thanks for caring!

I am attaching a new patch.
In this patch I moved the SQUID_CHECK_OPENSSL_GETCERTIFICATE_WORKS  as 
you suggested.

But also my last patch was buggy, the AC_CHECK_LIB did not search at the 
correct directories for libssl library.

In this patch I moved the "SQUID_STATE_ROLLBACK(squid_openssl_state)" 
line some lines down to have the correct libraries search path.
Is it ok, or it is better to open a new SQUID_STATE_SAVE/ROLLBACK just 
for AC_CHECK_LIB?


PS. Finally, this easy to fix issue, is one more prove that it is better 
to not start fixing files involved with this satanic tool called autoconf!

Yes, of course. If we have to support same-API variations, then feature
tests are the right solution. I hope there is consensus around that!
Moreover, feature tests are often the right solution even when there are
no same-API variations and all features _can_ be reliably detected by
API version tests.

The difficult question is: Given scarce resources, which is better:

  1. spending many hours on supporting OpenSSL API variations or
  2. spending those hours on other pressing Squid issues?

I do not know the correct answer, but I know that

* it is a difficult question without an algorithmic solution;
* such questions often create expensive discussions
  that often end without reaching consensus; and
* the Project lacks a mechanism to resolve consensus deadlocks.

Alex.

Of course I agree with you. In many cases we used openSSL version just 
because it was easier and this is wrong.

However is not easy to always use this method. The OpenSSL-1.1.0 put 
many API changes trying to hide structure members from user and replace 
with API calls instead. Also has many API changes, I suppose to make API 
more consistent.

This is resulted to many changes and it will not be easy to check 
availability for each of the investigated functions and API changes.

Individual feature tests are not panacea. When dealing with a large
across-the-board change like the one you are describing above, it is
often better to have a single test and a single marker for all affected
functions:

#if OPENSSL_EXPOSES_MEMBERS
    ...old code here, possibly with other feature #if tests...
#else
    ...new code here, possibly with other feature #if tests...
#endif

Also, we probably should wrap all OpenSSL calls that are affected by
version variations. It is wrong to sprinkle regular code with numerous
#ifs. Yes, that probably means 20+ wrappers, but it is better than the
alternatives.

Alex.

That is indeed very true.

Basically, OpenSSL-1.0.x and OpenSSL-1.1.x are two quite different
APIs, and it is impossible to support both in the same application
program without either littering the code with lots of #ifdefs (no
matter whether testing for version numbers or features) or defining
large numbers of private wrappers.  Both solutions are hard to
maintain, cause a lot of work, and both are problematic from a
security perspective because both substantially hinder code auditing.
OpenSSL does not offer any kind of migration path from OpenSSL-1.0.x
to OpenSSL-1.1.x but dumps the maintenance cost of having to support
both APIs in parallel on each and every application software project.

That is exactly why - just as an example - OpenSSH decided to not
support the OpenSSL-1.1.x API at all, for now.  Of course, i don't
have the slightest idea whether that would be viable for squid.

> Individual feature tests are not panacea. When dealing with a large

FTR, i fully agree that *individual* feature tests are not a good
fit for *large-scale* API changes, and well-designed feature group
tests can occasionally help.  But even with those, supporting two
very different APIs in the same program tends to get messy no matter
what and will usually obfuscate the code.

Yours,
  Ingo

std::atomic<> is defined for integers and pointers. It is not defined
for "file locks", which are complex OS-maintained objects largely
invisible to Squid. C++11 std::atomic cannot magically make complex code
thread-safe (and still working as intended).

Protecting File::File() try {...} with a mutex does not make File
objects thread-safe.

By default, Squid code is not thread-safe and should not be thread-safe
because thread safety costs a lot (and Squid threads are isolated,
confined to a tiny subset of Squid code). Squid PID file management code
is not thread-safe. Squid parts those threads "reach" have to be
thread-safe, but they are not reaching the proposed code or the code it
replaces.

Please withdraw your request.


Thank you,

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Do not die silently when dying early
Message-ID: <ff8d00c0-09ee-eace-1dca-75b4a57cf93d@measurement-factory.com>

Hello,

    The attached patch allows Squid to report various problems (e.g.,
mishandled exceptions) that may occur very early in Squid lifetime,
before proper logging is configured by the first _db_init() call.

To enable such early reporting, we started with a trivial debug.cc change:

  -FILE *debug_log = NULL;
  +FILE *debug_log = stderr;

... but then realized that debug_log may not be assigned early enough!
The resulting changes ensure that we can log (to stderr if necessary) as
soon as stderr itself is initialized. They also polish related logging
code, including localization of stderr checks and elimination of
double-closure during log rotation on Windows.

These reporting changes do not bypass or eliminate any failures.

This patch is independent from the "Do not die silently when dying via
std::terminate()" patch posted a few days ago, but, in combination, the
two patches fix reporting of early std::terminate() deaths.


Cheers,

Alex.

Audit:

in src/Debug.h:

* instead of adding yet another wrapper macro, please replace all uses 
of debug_log with DebugStream().
  - we already know from earlier macros that these just lead us to much 
more pain and long arguments in future developments.
  - the important comment by Duane in src/main.cc SquidShutdown() is now 
needing an update to reference the current symbol names.

in src/debug.cc:

* debugOpenLog()
  - since the bulk of the function is being altered please take the opportunity to remove the use of NULL in there.

  - in the else condition after fopen() we are writing explicitly to stderr then clearing TheLog. It seems to me that a better thing would be to do is write that notice to TheLog before clearing it, to perror() and then to TheLog after clearing it. Which should result in all places the admin might look getting the message, and the log writes can be via debugs() instead of fprintf().

I will not do that because many (most?) debug_log users should not use
DebugStream(). They should use the standard debugs() API. However,
carefully fixing that code is outside this particular change scope.

Compared to HERE and NULL, there are very few debug_log users. The
primary reason I left them alone is that many of them require
non-trivial out-of-scope changes other than dumb renaming. It is
actually a good idea to leave the old macro in place as a marker for
that code.


>  - the important comment by Duane in src/main.cc SquidShutdown() is now
> needing an update to reference the current symbol names.

Since I am refusing to remove debug_log in this patch, the comment does
not need updating. The comment itself should be removed as stale (or
completely rewritten) because (a) Squid provides several services that
must function beyond main() and (b) those services should not have a
"close" API so that we do not need to warn anybody not to use that wrong
API.

I am not going to do what I think is wrong and what I continue to
discourage others from doing. The pain reduction rule we all should
follow IMO is "If you do not have to change a line for in-scope reasons,
then do not change that line".

TheLog is usually closed at the time of that "else" code execution. The
correct solution here is to use debugs(), while making sure that API
works in this (and nearly any other) context and logs to stderr and
syslog as needed. That change is outside this patch scope.

Did I convince you that none of the above requested changes are required?


Thank you,

Alex.

>From my point of view when maintaining the RPM's for couple distributions I am looking at:
Would a specific OpenSSL library hit the distributions I maintain or not or just in a couple years?
But I am not sure about the concern of the developers since I read something about gcc 6 which is the cutting edge version of gcc to my knowledge.

And I want to understand:
What is the aim of the Squid-Cache software development team for Versions 3.5, 4.X, 5.X?
Also, Do we expect the main line linux distributions to use the cutting edge gcc or OpenSSL or 
we are just in the stage which we try to patch up things before the actual integration of these tools will be done?(can take even couple years..)

GCC-7 is now the latest. GCC-6 is old enough for some "stable" 
distributions to be including it.

Each member of the team has different goals/aims. What actually happens 
is somewhat the intersection of those ideas.

As maintainer my goals are to get the last bugs of v4 closed and release 
it, dropping formal support for v3.5 before April 2024.

Officially we support as many OS as possible for their latest stable 
distribution release, and pre-stable releases if we can. Older releases 
and LTS are left to the OS vendors themselves for maintenance or 
sponsored work.


As for those specific mentioned software;

* Squid-3.5 are expected to be compatible with GCC-4.*, OpenSSL-0.9.* 
and OpenSSL-1.0.* (the 'old' libssl API).

* Squid-4+ are expected to be compatible with GCC-5+ and OpenSSL-1.*.

Of course respectively newer or older versions may work, but that is 
more luck than intention.

Hi,

I'm saw errors like these below:

2017/05/23 14:35:34 kid2| helperHandleRead: unexpected reply on channel 0 from redirector #Hlpr2 '220543.35796293814'
2017/05/23 14:35:34 kid2| helperHandleRead: unexpected reply on channel 0 from redirector #Hlpr2 '3380'
2017/05/23 14:35:34 kid2| helperHandleRead: unexpected reply on channel 0 from redirector #Hlpr2 '2'
2017/05/23 14:35:34 kid2| helperHandleRead: unexpected reply on channel 0 from redirector #Hlpr2 'd'
2017/05/23 14:35:34 kid2| helperHandleRead: unexpected reply on channel 0 from redirector #Hlpr2 'null"'

It seems like a memory corruption, since sometimes the srv->rbuf data shows some HTML content not related to a valid reply.
I'm currently using squid 3.5.25.

Any clue?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] Adds support for --long-acl-options
Message-ID: <37bc7e61-69e3-eed7-f459-43f98d0d29c3@chtsanti.net>

Adds support for --long-acl-options

This patch adds support for --long-acl-options. The old single-letter 
ACL "flags" code was refactored to support long option names (with 
option-specific value types) without significant per-ACL-object 
performance/RAM overheads and without creating a global registry for all 
possible options. This refactoring (unexpectedly) resulted in removal of 
a lot of unreliable static initialization code.

Refactoring fixed ACL flags parsing code that was dangerously 
misinterpreting -i and +i flags in several contexts. For example, each 
of the three cases below was misinterpreted as if three domains were 
configured (e.g., "+i", "-z", and "example.com") on each line instead of 
one domain ("example.com"):

         acl parsedAsThreeDomains dstdomain +i -i .example.com
         acl parsedAsThreeDomains dstdomain -i +i .example.com
         acl parsedAsThreeDomains dstdomain +i -z .example.com

TODO: Finish ACL::clone() removal. Then consider removing any unused 
ACLData::clone() and associated ACL/ACLData copying methods.

This is a Measurement Factory project.

  for example what the helper is being passed by Squid and what it

The first sentence in the second paragraph can be removed as it
duplicates the first paragraph.

The above are minor polishing touches to the proposed commit message
which can be accommodated during commit. I support committing these
changes, but I have not reviewed the very latest version and wrote parts
of an earlier version.


FYI: Factory is almost done with a patch that actually adds --long
options to the server_name ACL (and that motivated this refactoring
work). We decided to split the two sets of changes to ease review of
that second/upcoming patch.


Thank you,

Okay to be more accurate:

  For the 1st destination ps_state::handlePath() calls noteDestination() 
which results in the entire TunnelState::startConnecting() / 
FwdState::startConnectionOrFail() sequence happening synchronously 
before returning to ps_state::handlePaths() and peerSelectDnsResults() 
for the 2nd path.

Also the same sequence happens for every Nth destination with 
unpredictable values of N.

... There do not seem to be any performance gains from this redesign for 
transactions where there are less than 3 upstream servers. Which is the 
common case. The synchronous processing may make the one transaction 
reach connection faster, but that is just taking CPU cycles from / 
slowing other transactions.


It might be worth initiating that noteDestination() sub-path as async 
step to avoid the remaining delay. (not asking for it to happen now, 
maybe a TODO note).

I mean the forwarding timeout on "Squid hangs for X" complaints I deal 
with in squid-users. The X is no longer determined by which component is 
being problematic. It was nice being able to point squid-users questions 
in roughly the right direction without resorting to logs very often.

Ah, you are right. I was mistaking the peerSelectDns*() function.



Something is still bothering me about the call sequence when M of N 
destinations are passed to FwdState and the Mth one goes through the 
FwdState::complete(){ if (reforward()) ... } path due to explicit 
upstream 4xx/5xx response. It seems that will end with a forwarding 
error if the remaining peers do not yet have DNS results available in 
serverDestinations.


eg. the sequence for 3 possible destinations:

1) destination A gets found and noteDestination(A) called
  1a) this triggers the async startConnectionOrFail()
  1b) A gets connected and request sent ...

2) destination B hit a DNS timeout issue
   - so B never gets passed to FwdState and there is long enough delay 
for (1c) to happen.

1c) server 5xx response arrives for A,
   - the 5xx triggers the FwdState::connect() { if(reforward()) { ... } 
} path
   - which erases (1) from serverDestinations and calls 
startConnectionOrFail()
   - startConnectionOrFail() now has serverDestinations.empty() and an 
error to deliver

3) destination C gets abandoned because FwdState is now gone

Amos,

The problem mentioned before (first e-mail) happens with the squidGuard helper.

Sharing a single cache_dir (diskd) entry for a multiple worker setup is a valid approach, right?
Could be related to this setup the error below?

kid1| assertion failed: store.cc:1086: "EBIT_TEST(flags, ENTRY_ABORTED)"

What could cause this other error?

kid1| assertion failed: Read.cc:69: "fd_table[conn->fd].halfClosedReader != NULL"

I currently have both fatal errors in my servers. The last one with more occurrences. The servers have a lot of traffic and I'm using two workers.

Thanks in advance.

William Lima

No, it is not valid. Diskd is not SMP-aware. Using a single diskd
cache_dir with multiple workers results in undefined behavior which may
include stuck transactions, wrong content served, assertions, core
dumps, etc.

The same applies to all other cache_dirs except for rock.

Hi Alex!

I started with no cache to try and the errors (assert) still occurs.

No, it is not valid. Diskd is not SMP-aware. Using a single diskd
cache_dir with multiple workers results in undefined behavior which may
include stuck transactions, wrong content served, assertions, core
dumps, etc.

The same applies to all other cache_dirs except for rock.

That is correct, although the phrasing "ENTIRE sequence" implies some
significant delays that are usually not there. The "sequence" usually
stops "soon" because it starts an async job (e.g., a PeerConnector or a
Client job).

This is both incorrect and largely irrelevant:

* Incorrect: The new code makes forwarding faster in cases where there
are two (or more) destinations and the second destination requires a DNS
lookup -- the new code will start using the first destination sooner
and, in typical cases, will finish forwarding sooner. See my earlier
specific example for an illustration.

* Irrelevant: This performance gain is just a nice side effect. The
primary goal is to facilitate Happy Eyeballs (which requires this
parallelization and more).


> The synchronous processing may make the one transaction

> slowing other transactions.

The patch parallelizes second DNS lookup and first HTTP transaction
execution. That parallelization is not about CPU cycles but about the
time the first HTTP transaction spends waiting for (blocked on) that
second (and usually unused) DNS lookup in the old code. The patched code
does not wait/block. Again, the gains from this optimization are not the
goal, but some environments will see them.

> step to avoid the remaining delay.

Yes, and my second thread email stated that much. However, the reason
for making that call async is not performance optimization (async calls
make performance worse, not better!) or delays. The reason is to shorten
the call stack, reducing the number of balls in the air and localizing bugs.

Agreed. Happy Eyeballs is a more complex "parallel" algorithm than the
current sequential DNS-then-HTTP approach. Parallel algorithms are more
difficult to implement, understand, and support. Hopefully, we agree
that Squid should support Happy Eyeballs despite those costs. Thus, I do
not understand why you are discussing multiple possible reasons behind
timeouts here.

( FWIW, resorting to messy debugging logs is necessary primarily because
of poor reporting/triaging interfaces in Squid. It is possible to make
triage much better without resorting to debugging logs. Such
improvements would help triaging Happy Eyeballs as well. )

Fixed in the attached take4 patch. The tunneling code already has
similar logic, but I missed it in the forwarding case.

I also explicitly cleared peer selection subscription when FwdState
tries to stop, just in case the self-clearing hack does not work.

An incremental diff showing changes since the last take is also attached.


Thank you,

Alex.

It feels like you are changing goalposts from "memory error" to
"assert". If you are getting assertions, search Squid bugzilla for
relevant bug reports. If there are none, file a new bug report.

Are you aware of the socket expense issue inherent in Happy Eyeballs? 
Each hop along the path generating M(2+2^N) outbound sockets where M is 
the number of HTTP carrying protocols and N the number of hops between 
it and the end-client - the protocol mix has gone from (M=2,N=4) when it 
was first identified to more like (M=6,N=6) these days.

I really do not think that is something to be aspiring towards creating. 
Parallelism and similar things within the internal processing yes, the 
"Happy Eyeballs" algorithm specifically no.

I would be interested if there are any measurements on the above two 
points but its not worth blocking the patch on (sorry, bad pun intended 
;-P ).

Yes, I am. This series of patches does not deal with the Happy Eyeballs
parts that increase the number of sockets, but, if those parts are
eventually implemented, the increase should be taken into account (e.g.,
limited or enabled/disabled via configuration), of course. Discussing
whether and how to do that is outside this thread scope.

Sorry, I seem to have lost context here: The measurements of which "two
points" would you like to see? And what kind of measurements? I see
nothing in the previous email that makes sense to measure (in this
project scope)...

If you are talking about the "parallelizes second DNS lookup and first
HTTP transaction execution" part, then the performance gain from that
change can be as huge/tiny as the tester wants -- it heavily depends on
DNS and HTTP transaction delays.


Thank you,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] [PATCH] ssl::server_name options to control matching
	logic.
Message-ID: <9ca7f39c-dffc-6ddd-ef39-a075edf0ceca@chtsanti.net>

This patch uses the the "--long-options" ACLs feature which posted to 
squid-dev under the mailthread:
  "PATCH] Adds support for --long-acl-options"


Patch description:

Many popular servers use certificates with several "alternative subject 
names" (SubjectAltName). Many of those names are wildcards. For example, 
a www.youtube.com certificate currently includes *.google.com and 50+ 
other subject names, most of which are wildcards.

Often, admins want server_name to match any of the subject names. This 
is useful to match any server belonging to a large conglomerate of 
companies, all including some *.example.com name in their certificates. 
The existing server_name functionality addresses this use case well.

The new ACL options address several other important use cases:

--consensus allows matching a part of the conglomerate when the part's 
subject name is included in certificates used by many other conglomerate 
parts (e.g., matching Google but not Youtube).

--client-requested allows both (a) SNI-based matching even after Squid 
obtains the server certificate and (b) pinpointing a particular server 
in a group of different servers all using the same wildcard certificate 
(e.g., matching appengine.example.com but not www.example.com when the 
certificate for has *.example.com subject).

--server-provided allows matching only after Squid obtains the server 
certificate and matches any of the conglomerate parts.

Also this patch fixes squid to log client SNI when client-first bumping 
mode is used too.

Subject: [squid-dev] Repeated assertions

Hi all,

   We are facing a strange problem with a squid 3.5.25 installation in one of our customers. Every minute an assertion like this "assertion failed: Read.cc:73: "fd_table[conn->fd].halfClosedReader != NULL" can be seen in the cache.log file. Below some information related to our current setup:

   - 2 physical servers running Squid 3.5.25 ( 1 instance per machine ) linked with OpenSSL 1.0.1e-57
   - haproxy to provide load balancing between the nodes + keepalived to provide vip
   - ~3000 users
   - diskd for cache
   - ssl bump enabled (config below)

http_port 58080 require-proxy-header dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=1KB generate-host-certificates=on ssl-bump cert=/opt/hsc/webcontrol/squid/etc/ssl/myCA.pem sslflags=NO_DEFAULT_CA

   (...)

acl s1_tls_connect at_step SslBump1
sslproxy_cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDSA-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDSA-RSA-AES256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA128-SHA:AES128-SHA:RC4-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!ADH
ssl_bump peek s1_tls_connect
ssl_bump bump all

   We have no idea why this is happening since we have another customer with the same setup and this doesn't happen.

   Could someone please help us to solve this problem? Our company is willing to pay for any kind of help (in this case contact me directly via e-mail or skype "juniorcunha.rs").

   Best regards.

So this ACL option somehow makes Squid aware of corporate ownership and 
political structures and human-world business operations? er, no.

Thankfully the text you are adding to cf.data.pre does a better job of 
explaining this option. Please use that text as commit message 
description instead of the above confusing fuzz - if you have to at all, 
having the docs as part of the patch makes it somewhat redundant to 
describe in commit message.

in src/acl/ServerName.h:

* please only use questions to document pre-existing code that you are 
not entirely sure of its behaviour, but where a guess is better than 
nothing at all.
  - I am referring of course to the "Ignore ... names?" questions.


in src/cf.data.pre:

* CONNECT handling is somewhat special because its URI is the authority, 
the Host header is ignored. So mentioning it here is wrong.
   - s/ target (a.k.a. Host header or URI) / target (a.k.a. URI) /


in src/ssl/ServerBump.h:

* "the SSL client SNI name" is both wrong and redundant.
  - SSL clients cannot send SNI, only TLS clients can send TLS extensions.
  - the 'N' in SNI is for name. So that text says "server name 
indication name".

  - "TLS client delivered SNI value. Empty string if none has been 
received." would be more accurate documentation for this member.


+1 with that polishing. Thank you.

That has worked quite well. The other patch was quite easily reviewed.

This one however is still a pain. I would really like to get my head 
around this change before it goes in, but I will not have time to even 
read it all within the next 7 days. Please hold committing this until I 
can followup. Thanks.

Actually, the answer to your rhetorical question is "yes", provided
those real-world things are expressed in certificate properties, as the
proposed description states. This brief high-level description helps
admins (with poor TLS knowledge) identify a relevant-to-them feature
that they can then study in detail by reading squid.conf.documented and
other sources.

In general, I am against using real company names in documentation. In
this particular case, foo.example.com names cannot quickly illustrate
the problem solved by the new --consensus option because the reader
would not be able to grasp the complex relationship between conglomerate
parts unless they already know about those relationships, identified in
reader's mind by familiar company names.


@Christos, I recommend replacing the above paragraph with the following
text which uses more "technical" words to say the same thing:

--consensus identifies transactions with a particular server when
server's subject name is also present in certificates used by many other
servers (e.g., matching transactions with a particular Google server but
not with all Youtube servers).


If Amos disagrees, then I would just drop those brief descriptions from
the commit message -- their value quickly diminishes with every minute
we waste on arguing about them.


HTH,

Alex.
