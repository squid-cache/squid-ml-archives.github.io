I would like to polish that question and correct its justification
logic: We can abuse admins as bug-finding guinea pigs only if we give
them tools to turn those bugs off. The &quot;has&quot; ACL is such a tool. Thus,
we need a &quot;has&quot; ACL component for any object that any ACL or ACL-driven
code uses (or should be using) conditionally. Hence, the question is:

Does Squid ACL or ACL-driven code correctly use (or should be using) ALE
conditionally?

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then ALE should be added to &quot;has&quot;. If the answer
is &quot;maybe&quot;, then ALE may be added to &quot;has&quot;.

Please note that it is not necessary to have a specific crash or warning
bug report for the answer to become &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;, justifying ALE
support in the &quot;has&quot; ACL. Squid code analysis is sufficient.

I cannot answer that question without doing more research, but I am sure
Eduard can find the right answer.


Thank you,

Alex.
