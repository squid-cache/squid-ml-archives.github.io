If there are plans about deprecating 'cache' directive, good, but it is a
possibly a future work which is unrelated here.  BTW, I think we can't 
simply
'rename' it to 'store_miss' or a mix of the two directives because 'cache'
directive supports both fast and slow checks, but both 'store_miss' and
'send_hit' only fast ones.  Probably I miss or do_not_understand something
important.

I looked through bug 3940 discussion but have not found any connection 
between
ACCESS_DUNNO/ACCESS_AUTH_REQUIRED/checkNoCacheDone() and
hostHeaderVerify()/hostHeaderVerifyFailed() methods. Yes, all these methods
may change RequestFlags flags, and that what
fix of r14984 is about, but how, roughly, hostHeaderVerifyFailed() may cause
ACCESS_DUNNO? In other words, I have not found any hints about your primary
change ACCESS_ALLOWED into ACCESS_DENIED: no in the patch preamble, no
in the bug discussion. I assume there are another threads/bugs where 
this change
probably was discussed. If so, could you please post such references here?
