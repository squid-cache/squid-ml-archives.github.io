GCC-7 is now the latest. GCC-6 is old enough for some &quot;stable&quot; 
distributions to be including it.

</I>
Each member of the team has different goals/aims. What actually happens 
is somewhat the intersection of those ideas.

As maintainer my goals are to get the last bugs of v4 closed and release 
it, dropping formal support for v3.5 before April 2024.


&gt;<i> Also, Do we expect the main line linux distributions to use the cutting edge gcc or OpenSSL or
</I>&gt;<i> we are just in the stage which we try to patch up things before the actual integration of these tools will be done?(can take even couple years..)
</I>
Officially we support as many OS as possible for their latest stable 
distribution release, and pre-stable releases if we can. Older releases 
and LTS are left to the OS vendors themselves for maintenance or 
sponsored work.


As for those specific mentioned software;

* Squid-3.5 are expected to be compatible with GCC-4.*, OpenSSL-0.9.* 
and OpenSSL-1.0.* (the 'old' libssl API).

* Squid-4+ are expected to be compatible with GCC-5+ and OpenSSL-1.*.

Of course respectively newer or older versions may work, but that is 
more luck than intention.
