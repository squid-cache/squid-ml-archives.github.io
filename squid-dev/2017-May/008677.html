<PRE>Okay.  +1 on the code now

</I>
Are you aware of the socket expense issue inherent in Happy Eyeballs? 
Each hop along the path generating M(2+2^N) outbound sockets where M is 
the number of HTTP carrying protocols and N the number of hops between 
it and the end-client - the protocol mix has gone from (M=2,N=4) when it 
was first identified to more like (M=6,N=6) these days.

I really do not think that is something to be aspiring towards creating. 
Parallelism and similar things within the internal processing yes, the 
&quot;Happy Eyeballs&quot; algorithm specifically no.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The synchronous processing may make the one transaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reach connection faster, but that is just taking CPU cycles from /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slowing other transactions.
</I>&gt;<i> The patch parallelizes second DNS lookup and first HTTP transaction
</I>&gt;<i> execution. That parallelization is not about CPU cycles but about the
</I>&gt;<i> time the first HTTP transaction spends waiting for (blocked on) that
</I>&gt;<i> second (and usually unused) DNS lookup in the old code. The patched code
</I>&gt;<i> does not wait/block. Again, the gains from this optimization are not the
</I>&gt;<i> goal, but some environments will see them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might be worth initiating that noteDestination() sub-path as async
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step to avoid the remaining delay.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and my second thread email stated that much. However, the reason
</I>&gt;<i> for making that call async is not performance optimization (async calls
</I>&gt;<i> make performance worse, not better!) or delays. The reason is to shorten
</I>&gt;<i> the call stack, reducing the number of balls in the air and localizing bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would be interested if there are any measurements on the above two 
points but its not worth blocking the patch on (sorry, bad pun intended 
;-P ).
