I mentioned it only because the debugs() lines you were talking were 
talking about a helper - which is a particular *type* of helper program...

Hold on. This is the first mention you have of any problem happening, 
after starting many threads asking how to debug Squid.

Please describe the details of these &quot;some problems&quot; that are happening. 
Then what you have done so far to look into them, and what you found out 
so far from those actions.



&gt;<i> So I just want to add and view debug information.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mind tell me more details on  how squid helps clients access the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTPS website, and which source files  should I focus on.
</I>&gt;<i> If squid ask openssl to parse the certificate it received, then where

</I>
Unfortunately what you have been asking about is a whole complicated 
protocol and even more complicated code spread over multiple programs 
and libraries. There is no &quot;just&quot; debug and fix the problem. You have to 
know what pieces to look at first and what those pieces are supposed to 
look like.

You seem to be very much a beginner with these things and that means it 
is probably going to be very hard to do it yourself right now.

To give you proper help we have to know what you are trying to do - not 
just that you are trying to debug something unspecified, but what the 
problem *really* is that you are trying to solve.
