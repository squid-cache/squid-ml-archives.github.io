<PRE>Hey All,

In the last 2 year I have tested Squid-Cache 3.5 and for general purposes
and it's stable.
The basic challenge is a simple internal traffic but there are couple other
challenges which I would like to verify.
The first thing is a test of squid against a very hostile environment like
the public Internet.
By testing on the public Internet I mean that it will sit in intercept or
trproxy mode ontop of a &quot;VPN&quot; service.
I believe that such a test would benefit us with more details about the
stability of the 3.5 branch and later maybe test the 4.x branch.
There are some legal issues in running such a setup and I would not be able
to run such a setup without some valid usage agreement.

First what do you all think about the idea in general?
Second, would we be able to somehow list the known 3.5 bugs?
I believe that such a list will help the admins to decide if Squid-Cache is
for them or not.
Currently there are 574 open bugs on the Bugzilla and maybe some of these
are not even relevant to 3.5.

Amos, You have suggested to walk me through some of the bugs to make our
lives much easier.
And I was thinking for example this bug: 3.2.1 SEGFAULT while freeing
ipcache_entry
<A HREF="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3644">http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3644</A>

It's a Solaris based squid which appeared in 3.2 and was confirmed by the
reported as &quot;works for me&quot; but never been marked this way.
If I'm not wrong Yuri also works or worked with solaris and can verify if
this kind of a bug exists or not on 3.5 can then we can close it as &quot;works
for me&quot;.


Also this bug: PURGE not purging hot objects (TCP_MEM_HIT ) with
memory_cache_shared on
<A HREF="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3888">http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3888</A>

Which I have seen that some work is being done on github  to resolve this
bug(3888)
It's there for at-least 3 years but nobody changed the milestone to what so
version.
I upped up the milestone to 3.5 since any patch will not be created by the
squid project itself to older versions then 3.5 ie .3.4 and down.
If you think that the milestone is 5 or 4 please change accordingly.

Thnank,
Eliezer
