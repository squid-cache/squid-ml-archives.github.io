<PRE>OK then.
If it's doable then it's only waiting for the client who will want to fund this feature.

Thanks,
Eliezer

You need ACLs that can match various TLS Client Hello fields (mostly
message version, protocol version, and ciphers) and a knowledgebase of
typical Hellos for the devices/clients you are interested in. A
Hello-based solution cannot be 100% reliable, but I bet you can identify
many popular OS versions (and, as a consequence, even some physical
devices) with a good-enough probability (for most applications).

IIRC, Squid does not have ACLs that interrogate TLS Client Hello with
the exception of SNI (i.e., ssl::server_name --client_requested).
However, it should not be very difficult to add such ACLs and they would
be generally useful IMO.


Forward proxies can also examine CONNECT headers. That is already
supported AFAIK.


Examining TCP/IP packet headers would also be useful in many cases, but
that is harder to do directly in Squid.


HTH,

Alex.
