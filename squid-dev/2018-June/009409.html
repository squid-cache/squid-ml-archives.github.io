<PRE>I have successfully installed squid server (On Centos) .. My servers has five ip addresses . I have configured all 5 ip addresses for squid... so clients can connect with any ip address and with tcp_outgoing_address client will get same ip address from which ip address he is connecting.

But the problem is all my clients are behind a same router and having the same public ip address.

Now the problem is .. Let see client one use server 1.1.1.0 ip address to connect squid first, he is getting server 1.1.1.0 ip address for his public ip.

Now Client two using server 2.2.2.0 ip address to connect squid , he is getting server 2.2.2.0 ip adddress for his public ip ...

But at this moment client's one public ip address is changing to 2.2.2.0 .

How I can configure squid, so each client will get dedicated public ip address from server at the same ip .
