Message-ID: <b1f19cf0-d8c6-5047-af1a-a495f0af7650@urlfilterdb.com>

After reading https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/11/supercookey-a-supercookie-built-into-tls-1-2-and-1-3/ I am wondering if the TLS 1.3 implementation in Squid will have an option to 
disable the 0rtt feature so that user tracking is reduced.

Subject: [squid-dev] how i can make each user to use only specify port in
	squid proxy
Message-ID: <1542714921571-0.post@n4.nabble.com>

I am starting to tunneling IPv6 with IPv4

so when I use my proxy in this way user:pass at IP:4040

it will let the user use the associated IPv6 with port 4040

which is working good

I do add different users

user1:pass user2:pass user3:pass user4:pass

by using /etc/squid/passwd

http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager
http_access allow localhost

auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
auth_param basic children 5
auth_param basic realm Proxy server provided by Market-Area
acl password proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access allow password
this is what I add in my conf file

and then I add the list of Ports

http_port 4040
http_port 4041
http_port 4042
http_port 4043
http_port 4044
i do acl with port 4040 to port name user1

acl user1 myportname 4040
then

outgoing address is ::IPv6:: user1
so now if i use

user1:pass at ipv4:4040

and use google to show my ip address it will show the correct ipv6 ip

same with all ports

now the issue

if i have 5 users and 5 ports and 5 ipv6

each user can assess all the ips

I mean

user1 can access >>> ipv4:4040 / ipv4:4041 etc... same with user2

what I am trying to do is

limit each user to one port

so user1 can only access ipv4:4040 and cant user ipv4:4041

As the article mentions the issue is also part of TLS/1.2 and the
features behind it can already be configured to disable as needed. It is
unlikely that we would remove such a useful config option any time soon.


Also, it is worth stating that this type of tracking does not work
through a TLS proxy. The TLS session between client and proxy is not
shared with server and vice versa. The proxy<->server TLS session which
it might try tracking contains multiplexed traffic from many clients so
is not a reliable per-user tracker to the server.


Things get a lot less clear when SSL-Bumping since there is a mix of
OpenSSL and Squid code doing things and actions like peek/stare/splice
may require side effects of preventing TLS feature removal/disable.

It is an admin choice how and when to use such actions though so again
already configurable if one understand what those actions do rather than
just blindly throwing copy-paste config settings at the proxy until
something "works".

Please use the squid-users mailing list for help using Squid.

This mailing list is for developers/programmers discussion about the
Squid code internals and functionality changes to it.

There are at hundreds, possibly thousands, of types of "tunnel". Squid
can tunnel, but you appear not to be using that functionality in any way.

Much of your explanation about what you are doing is written in vague
terms like this. It is not clear whether the problem you are currently
seeing is going to help you reach your actual goal or just a problem on
the way to an irrelevant situation. Please provide more precise details
about what you are doing when you re-post to squid-users. That will
greatly improve any assistance people can give you.

Message-ID: <CANYhRPwBBOs6WPQj6N4Fuk_eicq0YeAROJezmwH0mWMh00re4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Good day!

Just want to ask if squid transparent proxy setup is capable to verify
apple phones by connecting to apple website?

As per customer more or less 20,000 apple devices/phone must be verified to
apple.com daily.

Hope for your kind response. Thanks so much!

Regards
