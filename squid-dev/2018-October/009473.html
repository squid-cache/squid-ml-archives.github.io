Renaming source code is not unique. Squid-2.6 and Squid-2.7 were
actually a fork of the main Squid source code. &quot;Lusca&quot; is the name of a
proxy forked off Squid-2.7. &quot;SquidNT&quot; is another old one which was a
Windows rename of Squid-2.4 (or 2.5). There are others I forget exactly
the names of.

If you pay attention to the license details of Squid (in the CREDITS
file) you will notice from the first entry that the original Squid
itself was a renaming and extension of an even older proxy software
called 'cached' by the Harvest Project.


&gt;<i> is that a complex thing to be accomplished ?

Your time so far would have been better spent gathering your friends on
a beach and showing them a handful of sand thrown in the air.

No handful of sand in history has ever been thrown and fallen the same
way as that handful will have. That action is both far more complex,
much more truly unique, and just as useful as your requested change
appears to be.

If you are just looking for something to do and possibly impress others,
our Squid Project roadmap (&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/RoadMap">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/RoadMap</A>&gt; and
&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/RoadMap/Tasks">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/RoadMap/Tasks</A>&gt;) and bugzilla
(&lt;<A HREF="https://bugs.squid-cache.org/">https://bugs.squid-cache.org/</A>&gt;) have long lists of things that need to
be worked on.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> do you need to know what before helping me ? isnâ€™t it an open source code ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Squid is GPL licensed code. To change it you are required to comply with
the relevant GPL license in how you use the result.

One of those license requirements is that your code must be likewise
public and open source under the GPLv2 or later. So you are needing to
publicly acknowledge that it is Squid source code your changes are based
on, and exactly what you have changed to make it different from Squid.


At no point does the GPL license require anyone to spend their time
assisting you do any changes. And your friends are not likely to be
impressed with simply copying and running sed on some source code files.
They could do the same.

Alex and I respond to requests for help because it is in our own
separate interests to stay aware of what problems people are having with
Squid and what types of network environment it is being used for. So we
can make decisions about what things we need to focus on doing to keep
Squid being useful for the world at large.

Admin the world over have no regular need to rename random files and
words inside the source code we publish. So there is no interest in
spending our own precious time helping you with this particular request.


No one is preventing you posting, but the more this type of unexplained
request is repeated the less interest anyone has of even reading your
emails again let alone answering and helping. One day you may have a
real urgent problem and nobody looks at the help request for days.
