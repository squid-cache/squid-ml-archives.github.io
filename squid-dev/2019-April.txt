Subject: [squid-dev] Help setting up Squid proxy in my mac
Message-ID: <CADueu30nWz7DMugpUXW_FMPidVhx6Pr0ty2GrASi5T=KSyXvvg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I wanted to setup Squid proxy in my mac book pro in such a way that I can
get access to some sites and doesn't allow other sites. Initially I
downloaded the squid from homebrew after installing homebrew. After
installation, I noticed that my Squid folder inside Cellar doesn't have a
squid.conf file for me manipulate it.

Although there is an Ect directory in the same location as Cellar and
contains the files squid.conf, squid.conf.default and
squid.conf.default.default.

 In my network setting I tried entering the ip of my system with the port
number 3128 but even-though I gave permission to allow http access, the
chrome blocks all the http request.

 While going through tutorials, I noticed all of them are for ubuntu
operating system. Can you please help me on how should I configure in my
mac os so that my squid proxy con contain a list of sites that it can block
while allow connection to other sites.

Subject: [squid-dev] repository tags missing
Message-ID: <1368481a-d1d4-7410-4a22-b9bad5227fd0@suse.de>

Hi,

I'm looking in the squid repository on github[1], but there seems to be 
no tags in this repository since 4.0.21. Even the last 3.5.x release is 
missing. Are squid releases not tagged anymore or some hickup somewhere? 
Maybe tags are just not exported to github?
