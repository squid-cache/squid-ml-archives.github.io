Problem with that plan is that most of your requested &quot;should be in v5&quot;
list are new features. We already have enough features to make v5 a release.

&quot;Just one more feature&quot; is a very slippery slope that we have been
sliding down for most of this past year already. It is not a new one
either; you should well remember the long and painful release process
for v3.0, v3.2 and v4 when we waited on or accepted late feature
additions. It _always_ results in much longer and slower testing phases.


Truth is, most of what we *really* need in v5 is fixes for the bugs in
all those feature creep additions that got into master-to-be-v5 since my
previous arbitrary 'Feb 2019' branching plan. Were it not for those v5
would be stable or already fixing the bugs we have yet to find in those
initial features.

Frequent release -&gt; fewer feature change -&gt; fewer new bugs -&gt; happier
community. The sequence is simple and well-known.


Likewise our versioning policy (published since 2008):

 *10* features for a new major version.
 Bi-Monthly stable point release.
 Monthly beta of next version.
 Daily alpha of development work.


PS. I see you do have a sense of humour. &quot;There is no pressure to commit
to master&quot;. Thanks for the laugh :-). Though its NYE not April 1st.
