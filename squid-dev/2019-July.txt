Subject: [squid-dev] Fix handling of tiny invalid responses in v4
Message-ID: <78913833-1de0-81eb-50e9-85d6dfd66ee6@measurement-factory.com>

Hi Amos,

    Do you plan to commit the following v5/master fix to v4? If that is
your plan, then what is the current ETA and do you need help with
porting or testing these changes to/in v4?


Thank you,

Alex.

I plan to spend most of the next 4 days on Squid catching up with all
the things:

* Next round of backports starts in about 9-10 hrs with the patches on
the "not yet" list here
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/merge.html>. I am not
expecting any trouble from that lot.

* Then finishing up as many still outstanding PRs as I can so they can
be considered for the next round of backports.

* That final round of code backports starts in maybe 40hrs from now, all
going well.

* Next stable release with whatever has been completed over the weekend.

* Expect to see documentation Drafts appearing in board@ when I get to
the testing delay stage in about 2-3 days. With publication on Monday or
Tuesday following the release bundling.


What could do with help is checking the status of these PR:

 <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/339>
  - Christos: is there really anything author still has to change?

 <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/275>
 <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/427>
  - Alex: waiting your (re-)review

 <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/423>
  - Eduard: is the polish going to happen?


PS. yes PR 386 and 369 are at the top of my regular-PR TODO list. But
the Jeriko and similar changes necessarily needed my longer blocks of
time and attention more.
