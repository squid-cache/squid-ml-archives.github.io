Hi,

Does squid support RTMP/RTMPS live-streaming relay?

If yes, can you share some documentation?

Hi guys,

I will be effectively offline for the next few days. There are some PR
needing my review or re-review. As well as backports to v4.  I intend to
get to them as soon as I am back.

Cheers
Amos
