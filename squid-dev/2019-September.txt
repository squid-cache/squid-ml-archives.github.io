Hi all,

A request today for backporting large changes to v4 has prompted me to
take a look at where Squid-5 is in terms of being ready for branching.

As of a few weeks ago it passed the criteria for feature count.

There are 3 new major or higher bugs right now, 23 new ones in total
already known. Which is small enough to accept as a starting point.

 <https://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=blocker&bug_severity=critical&bug_severity=major&bug_severity=normal&bug_severity=minor&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bugidtype=include&columnlist=bug_severity%2Cversion%2Cop_sys%2Cshort_desc&list_id=7331&order=version%20DESC%2Cbug_severity%2Cbug_id&product=Squid&query_format=advanced&version=5>



So as a tentative plan, lets say 2 weeks away:

    27 Sep 2019

For the branching Squid-5 and a v5.0.1 Beta release shortly after.

Note: PR under review by the branching date will be ported should they
complete that review and be merged during the v5 beta series.


To get a late-PR exemption from the "no new features" or "no UI changes"
policy please reply to this message with a brief (one-liner) description
of the project and an ETA for PR review submission.
