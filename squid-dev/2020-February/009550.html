</I>&gt;<i> this context (e.g., both raw XML and wiki-like markups can be valid
</I>&gt;<i> SGML!). If you meant something specific by &quot;SGML&quot;, please clarify.
</I>
Exactly. We have the Linuxdoc toolchain already used for release notes
etc. so long as we have a simple set of rules about the markup used for
bits that cf_gen needs to pull out for code generation we can use any of
the more powerful markup in the documentation comment parts.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Automated rendering of squid.conf sources, including web site content
</I>&gt;<i> generation, should be straightforward with any good source format,
</I>&gt;<i> including writer-friendly formats. Thus, web site generation is not an
</I>&gt;<i> important deciding criteria here AFAICT.
</I>
It is an existing use-case for documentation output we need to maintain.
We can still decide to forego adding nice-to-have outputs that do not exist.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, an ideal markup language for cf.data.pre (or its replacements)
</I>&gt;<i> would satisfy these draft high-level criteria:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Writer-friendly. Proper whitespace, indentation, and other
</I>&gt;<i> presentation features of the _rendered_ output are the responsibility of
</I>&gt;<i> renderes, not content writers. Decent _sources_ formatting should be
</I>&gt;<i> automatically handled by popular modern text editors that developers
</I>&gt;<i> already use. No torturing humans with counting tags or brackets.
</I>
This nullifies the argument that XML is torturous. Good editing tools
can handle XML easily.

For writers dealing with the tags directly a simple SGML markup is
better. But not a huge amount.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Expressive enough to define all the squid.conf concepts that we want
</I>&gt;<i> to keep/support, so that they can be rendered beautifully without hacks.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if we agree that those sections are a good idea, then this
</I>&gt;<i> item includes support for introduction sections that define no
</I>&gt;<i> configuration options themselves.
</I>
What are you calling squid.conf concepts here?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Supports documentation duplication avoidance so that we do not have
</I>&gt;<i> to duplicate a lot of text or refer the reader to directive X for
</I>&gt;<i> details of directive Y functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The XML idea supports that. I am not sure about SGML.

All the other text syntax I'm aware of do not have nice writer-friendly
referencing. The YAML-like one we currently have is a case in point.



&gt;<i> 4. Allows for automated validation of internal cross-references (and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly other internal concepts that can be validated). Specification
</I>&gt;<i> of these cross-references is covered by item 2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Allows for automated spellchecking without dangerous exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Any syntax we choose with good tooling should support that. If not the
requirement to translate between formats will at least involve moving
the text parts into a format that can be spell-checked (HTML).


&gt;<i> 6. Git-friendly: Adding two new unrelated directives does not lead to
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting pull requests.
</I>
This is unrealistic so long as the source code remains in one file. Only
edits to independent files are guaranteed not to conflict.

What I am considering is a change to the internal syntax within
cf.data.pre. At most a filename/extension change to match. It remains a
source code file like any other.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7. Either already well-known or easy to learn by example (as far as
</I>&gt;<i> major used concepts are concerned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
AFAIK, that effectively means SGML or XML.


&gt;<i> 8. Can be easily parsed using programming languages that our renderers
</I>&gt;<i> are (going to be) written in (e.g., using existing parser libraries). We
</I>&gt;<i> should probably discuss whether these renderers should be (re)written in
</I>&gt;<i> some specific languages.
</I>
This is where XML has the the advantage over wider SGML. Both are
parseable, but XML end-tags and libxml make is a bit more simple for the
cf_gen implementation.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 9. Translation-friendly. (I do not know what that entails, but I am sure
</I>&gt;<i> that others can detail this reqiurement.)
</I>
Human language translation requires one of the formats which
translate-toolkit can use as input, OR being easily converted into one
of those with machine translation.

Machine translation only requires a toolchain that knows both formats.
Translation of cf.data.pre into HTML for the web and man pages for
distro documentation of using SGML.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is unlikely that we can find a language that fully satisfies all the
</I>&gt;<i> criteria, but I hope that we can come close. It is not a new/unusual
</I>&gt;<i> problem. Let's not rush into rewrites until we agree on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
XML stand out in front IMO. Including with the writer-friendly criteria
- it can be as simple as what we have now, or as complicated as one
wants to make it.

A few lines of awk and we could auto-convert a XML file for input to
cf_gen from the existing cf.data.pre with no change to what writers deal
with beyond suddenly gaining the ability to use XML references in the
DOC_* sections.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main point in favour of these is that we already have infrastructure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in place for ESI and release notes. It would be less work to re-use one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of those than integrate a new library or tooling for some other format.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reusing existing infrastructure is a nice bonus, of course, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> that any major format rework should be focusing on optimizing for the
</I>&gt;<i> long-term. Any infrastructure changes required to render static content
</I>&gt;<i> on a web site seem relatively small to me. (And does not ESI support
</I>&gt;<i> injection of any content, not just XML-based?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Any suggestions of formats I should look at then?
