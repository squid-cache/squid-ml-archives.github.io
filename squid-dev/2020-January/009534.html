FWIW, I was not trying to revive this thread. I simply added a reference
to the (official) next generation of the ideas expressed on that old
thread. IIRC, I posted this &quot;closure&quot; in part because PR 270 is open,
and one of my old comments there refers to this thread.


&gt;<i> AIUI your proposals were alternatives to PR 270 - ways to replace the
</I>&gt;<i> fde::note field instead of just updating it to SBuf.
</I>
This thread kept the fde::note field and its SBuf conversion introduced
in PR 270. The thread focused on adding transaction information without
the performance sacrifices. Please see the original message for details:
<A HREF="http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2019-February/009503.html">http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-dev/2019-February/009503.html</A>


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we are going to have to do a security audit on the values displayed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> by the CodeContext objects. That is due to how the fde::note are sent
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> over the public network in clear-text transactions for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mgr:filedescriptors report.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Overall, I doubt such an audit is a good idea -- only the Squid admin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can correctly decide whether it is OK to expose transaction information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in cache manager responses[1,2].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> see responses below to [1] and [2]. Since you are apparently not seeking
</I>&gt;<i> to replace the mgr:filedescriptors report fde::note field with
</I>&gt;<i> fde::codeContext display - then please take it as a general security
</I>&gt;<i> approach policy for handling that type of change.
</I>
Sorry, I do not understand what &quot;it&quot; and &quot;that type of change&quot; refers to
in your last sentence, especially since those references follow a text
that describes what is _not_ going to happen (i.e. &quot;you are apparently
not ...&quot;). My argument was (and is) that an audit without a
configuration option (or an equivalent shared definition of &quot;sensitive&quot;
and &quot;exposure&quot;) would be largely impractical or meaningless because the
auditor would not be able to properly identify problems with exposure of
sensitive info.


&gt;&gt;<i> If there is demand for limiting that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposure, I would rather add a configuration directive that would allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the admin to control whether Squid is allowed to report context in cache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manager responses, error pages, etc.
</I>
&gt;<i> We do not have to default such an option to publish everything on the
</I>&gt;<i> off chance it is safe. Our objective here is to prevent CVEs occuring.
</I>&gt;<i> To achieve that we should be defaulting to elide sensitive details from
</I>&gt;<i> public view unless configured to show them.
</I>
I have no problems with the &quot;do not publish&quot; default for areas where the
information may go to a 3rd party unexpectedly (for a reasonable admin).
You started your paragraph with &quot;we do not have to X&quot;. I hope I did not
imply anywhere that we have to X.


&gt;<i> The details I am thinking of most prominently here are things like
</I>&gt;<i> credentials and tokens in the auth processing contexts. URL history and
</I>&gt;<i> keys in the SSL-Bump context. Access to Squid internal memory spaces on
</I>&gt;<i> the server. There are probably others we will uncover later. Anything
</I>&gt;<i> that could be reported as a sensitive information leak and assigned a CVE.
</I>
I think we are on the same page here although, IIRC, we already report
URLs in fde::notes.


&gt;&gt;<i> [1] Some of the transaction context is already exposed in the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cache manager responses. We may want to add more details or report fewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details, but there is no paradigm shift here.
</I>
&gt;<i> &quot;some&quot; renders this argument irrelevant. The leak issues will be
</I>&gt;<i> cropping up about the *new* data if we let that contain anything sensitive.
</I>
I do not follow. If we already expose sensitive data in interface X,
then a reasonable admin would be expected to protect that interface and,
hence, we can add similarly sensitive details there with little risk.
The only other reasonable action that I can see is to file a CVE for
what we are already doing, admitting that we have exposed too much (even
though nobody complained [loudly enough] about that old exposure).


&gt;&gt;<i> [2] In some deployment environments, cache manager responses are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delivered over secure channels.
</I>
&gt;<i> &quot;some&quot; renders this argument irrelevant. The leak issues will be
</I>&gt;<i> cropping up where they are *not* secured.
</I>
I think the context got lost here. The argument was that, in general,
the admin has to decide: In some environments, any exposure is safe,
even new exposure, because the admin has already protected (or disabled)
the affected interface (e.g., [2]). In other environments, any exposure
is undesirable, especially new exposure. Squid cannot distinguish one
environment from another without a new configuration option.
