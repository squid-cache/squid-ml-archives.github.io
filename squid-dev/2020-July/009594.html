</I>
What does it mean to claim that &quot;Squid v6 goal is X&quot;? Does &quot;reaching X&quot;
become a precondition for the v6 release? Something else? Our RoadMap
page talks of _features_ (with specific properties) driving release
process, not goals. I assume the two concepts are different, but I do
not know what the term &quot;goal&quot; really means here.

Does the paragraph quoted below represent a complete answer to my
question or just a partial description of what we are trying to define here?

&gt;<i> It just gives people some rough direction to
</I>&gt;<i> consider when struggling with selecting of new work to start.
</I>
IMHO, Squid work selection should be primarily driven by
developer-specific factors that usually have little to do with
Project-declared release goals, whatever they are.

Until the meaning of &quot;release goal&quot; is clear to me, I can only comment
on the validity of the proposed goals from a general &quot;What is a good
goal in a software development project?&quot; point of view. Please do not
misinterpret my responses below as an agreement (or disagreement)
regarding adding those items as v6 release goals.

As of now, I see no reason to have release goals other than the already
established practice of tracking TODO features on the RoadMap. I am very
open to changing my position, but that change would require developing a
shared definition of the term &quot;release goal&quot;. Hence my question above...


&gt;<i> The last few version we have focused on C++11 optimizations and code
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades. 
</I>
I do not think this summary is meaningful or accurate, but it is a
matter of opinion/perspective.


&gt;<i> 0) the ongoing project to clarify OS support and testing.
</I>
I would support that project if you replace &quot;clarify&quot; with &quot;define&quot; or
something similarly meaningful/measurable.


&gt;<i> 1) remove features that have been deprecated since Squid-3 days.
</I>
This goal needs polishing: All such features? Some features we agree on
(e.g., the two you listed explicitly -- WAIS and ICP)? What determines
that feature F has been deprecated &quot;since v3 days&quot;?


&gt;<i> 2) proposing some next features to be removed ASAP, possibly removing
</I>&gt;<i> them this release.
</I>&gt;<i>  - send-announce removal
</I>&gt;<i>  - SMB_LM helper removal
</I>
This needs to be rephrased as a meaningful goal. Perhaps you meant
&quot;Removal of the following features: ...&quot;? If yes, we need to make a
decision for each feature. It is not clear (to me) whether the two
specific examples have something in common here.


&gt;<i> 3) drop (all?) bitrotten code
</I>
Even with &quot;all&quot; in place, this is not a valid goal due to the vagueness
of the term &quot;bitrotten code&quot;.


&gt;<i> 4) statistic addition to measure feature use. To improve admin ability
</I>&gt;<i> to answer our &quot;are you using this feature&quot; requests.
</I>
I think Squid usage reporting would be a very nice feature (at virtually
any granularity) _if_ we have enough admin support to enable such
reporting by default. Perhaps we should ask on squid-users first?


HTH,

Alex.
