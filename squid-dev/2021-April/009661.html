<PRE>Hi all,

I have an extremely specific question about manipulating Squid to run to in
a very specific way.
Due to the complexity, I will gladly accept a &quot;not possible&quot; answer.

I need to make the following changes to Squid, or somehow manipulate Squid
to:

1) Always consider a client intercepted. This would mean
that COMM_INTERCEPTION is set for every client no matter what.

2) NS lookups for domains needs to be disabled or simply return localhost.
I have considered setting AI_NUMERICHOST flag for every getaddrinfo() call,
but I don't think this function is used for making connections to a website
(gethostbyname seems to be used in some places).

3) Every outward connection Squid makes needs to be forwarded to localhost
on a specific port.


Why do I need to do this?
I have a large set of files which contain HTTP requests (headers included).
I have a large set of files which contain HTTP responses (headers included).

I would like to loop the HTTP requests, sending each request to Squid, and
then I would like to run a loop, responding with each of the HTTP responses
I have stored. The idea is to get a nice code coverage report which I can
use for research later on.

Like I said, this is a bit complicated, but I thought I would act, perhaps
somebody has an interesting idea how to do this :-). It will most certainly
require me to somehow defile the source code, but this is just temporary
and is nothing to do with a production service.

Happy to hear any ideas.

Cheers,
Josh
