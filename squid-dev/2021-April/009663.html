You may also be able to use a cache_peer or URL rewriter for this.

</I>&gt;<i>     1) Always consider a client intercepted. This would mean

</I>&gt;<i>     getaddrinfo() call, but I don't think this function is used for
</I>&gt;<i>     making connections to a website (gethostbyname seems to be used in
</I>&gt;<i>     some places).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     3) Every outward connection Squid makes needs to be forwarded to
</I>&gt;<i>     localhost on a specific port.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Why do I need to do this?

</I>&gt;<i>     I have a large set of files which contain HTTP responses (headers

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I would like to loop the HTTP requests, sending each request to
</I>&gt;<i>     Squid, and then I would like to run a loop, responding with each of
</I>&gt;<i>     the HTTP responses I have stored. The idea is to get a nice code
</I>&gt;<i>     coverage report which I can use for research later on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Like I said, this is a bit complicated, but I thought I would act,
</I>&gt;<i>     perhaps somebody has an interesting idea how to do this :-). It will
</I>&gt;<i>     most certainly require me to somehow defile the source code, but
</I>&gt;<i>     this is just temporary and is nothing to do with a production service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Happy to hear any ideas.
