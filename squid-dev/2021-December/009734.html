Squid code that should be removed (from any reasonable person point of
view) may cause significant pain. I (and, I bet, others) have wasted a
lot of time dealing with such code. Old OSes and platforms are not be
the _biggest_ contributor here, but they are a contributor, and I hope
that this thread will result in a scheme that is applicable to a much
wider set of code snippets than those OS hacks alone.

Nobody questions the real benefits of supporting non-Linux platforms
AFAICT. The questions usually revolve around the benefits of a given
OS-specific code snippet -- do they outweigh the drawbacks associated
with it? It is impossible to correctly answer such questions in general,
especially in the context of a starving Project. We may have to paint
with a much broader pragmatic brush to arrive at imperfect but
reusable/generic solutions that we can afford.

</I>
I would go one step further and claim that any OS-specific Squid code
that exists to accomodate OS Foo idiosyncrasies is the responsibility of
the folks working on OS Foo-based distributions. It should not be the
responsibility of the Squid project. Ideally, we should not have such
code in Squid. This is what distro patches/adjustments are for.
