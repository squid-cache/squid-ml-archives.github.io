Hi Andrej,

  Alex has summarized the state of things pretty accurately. Since CVE 
is already public please feel free to open a bug report on our Bugzilla. 
That will help with getting the fix backported to official releases.

If you are able to do the testing I am happy to try and fix it for you.

Amos
