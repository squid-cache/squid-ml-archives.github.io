That's a very fair point.
&quot;main targets&quot; to me means that any regression in build or unit tests
on these platforms is PR-blocking. We aim to deliver a working build
out of the box on these environments, with no need of maintainer
patches. Once achieved this status on any of these platforms,
regressions on it are release blockers.
&quot;support as best effort&quot; means that we keep these environment as build
options, and test builds on them. Regressions on build or unit tests
on these environments are not PR-blocking but we strongly encourage
the PR owner to fix these platforms with followup PRs. We aim to
deliver an out-of-the-box build on these platforms but failure to do
so or regressions are not a release blocker


&gt;<i> &gt; If anyone in the community wants to support/maintain extra OSes or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architectures, they're very welcome to do so
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;welcome&quot;, do you mean something like &quot;we will accept high-quality
</I>&gt;<i> PRs adding such extra support to Squid&quot;? Or &quot;we will consider sharing
</I>&gt;<i> references to your work, but please do not ask us to merge your
</I>&gt;<i> OS-specific changes into the official Squid code&quot;? Something else? This
</I>&gt;<i> bit is critical for understanding the real effect of this proposal IMO.
</I>
Fair point. I'd go for the former. If someone has an environment they
want to support and do so without adding complexity to the code base,
it's a good policy to enable that. The question is &quot;how much
complexity is it healthy to impose on other platforms to support
niche/obsolete ones?&quot;
While setting an objective bar is hard to impossible, this is my
attempt to set one for the most active group of developers

&gt;<i> If we manage to and agree on what platforms to &quot;support&quot; and on removing
</I>&gt;<i> code dedicated to unsupported platforms, great! If we fail, I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to propose an alternative scheme for the removal of platform-specific
</I>&gt;<i> (or any other) code from the official master branch:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A PR dedicated to code removal can be merged if it satisfies the
</I>&gt;<i> following criteria:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Two positive votes from core developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. No negative votes.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Voting lasted for 30+ calendar days.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The removal PR is announced in a PR-dedicated squid-users post.
</I>&gt;<i>    This announcement resets the 30+ day timer.
</I>
How about instead something along the lines of:
1. announce on squid-users about intent to remove support for a platform
2. wait for objections for 15 days
3. PR following standard merge procedure

&gt;<i> The author and reviewers do not have to justify the removal and the
</I>&gt;<i> votes if the PR author elects to use this special code removal
</I>&gt;<i> procedure. We simply trust they have good reasons to remove, support
</I>&gt;<i> removal, or block it.
</I>
My proposal doesn't change the merge process at all, it mostly gives
any active users in the candidate for removal a chance to speak up. I
think 15 days are a good window to not stall development too long, but
it can be extended if others feel we should
