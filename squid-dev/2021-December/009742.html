My proposal is trying to solve the specific problem that recent PRs
(attempting to remove some code) have faced: The reviewer asked _why_ we
are removing code, and the author closed the PR instead of developing
consensus regarding the correct answer to that question[1]. My proposal
establishes a special track for code removal PRs so that they do not
have to answer the (otherwise standard) &quot;why&quot; question.

Your proposal changes nothing as far as that problem is concerned. Thus,
unless that past experience has altered our understanding of the
problem, we are likely to face the same problem again!

Needless to say, getting squid-users feedback is nice -- both proposals
share that feature. However, even an enthusiastic squid-users support
for X removal cannot replace the answer to the &quot;why&quot; question. This is
why I am proposing to change the rules to remove that question for some PRs.


Hope this clarifies,

Alex.
