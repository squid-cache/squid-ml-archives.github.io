[1] is about removal of a trivial piece of code that has no harm leaving 
in place.

As I stated in followup what I regard as reasonable justification *was* 
given up front. If that was not enough for agreement to merge it was not 
worth the jumping through hoops in the first place. Let alone creating a 
whole new bureaucratic policy and management process.

As I said in other discussions, we already have a deprecation+removal 
process that works fine and matches the industry standard practices when 
a code change is even suspected to matter to anyone at all. That process 
gives far more than just 30 days to inform any interested community 
members and does not limit the notification channels.

If anyone picks up the code removal in [1] again they should follow that 
process since that code is now obviously of some importance to reviewer 
Alex.
