</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PR is announced in a PR-dedicated squid-users post. This
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> announcement resets the 30+ day timer.
</I>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How about instead something along the lines of:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. announce on squid-users about intent to remove support for a platform
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. wait for objections for 15 days
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. PR following standard merge procedure
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> My proposal is trying to solve the specific problem that recent PRs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (attempting to remove some code) have faced: The reviewer asked _why_ we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are removing code, and the author closed the PR instead of developing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus regarding the correct answer to that question[1]. My proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> establishes a special track for code removal PRs so that they do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to answer the (otherwise standard) &quot;why&quot; question.
</I>

&gt;<i> [1] is about removal of a trivial piece of code that has no harm leaving
</I>&gt;<i> in place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I stated in followup what I regard as reasonable justification *was*
</I>&gt;<i> given up front. If that was not enough for agreement to merge it was not
</I>&gt;<i> worth the jumping through hoops in the first place. Let alone creating a
</I>&gt;<i> whole new bureaucratic policy and management process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said in other discussions, we already have a deprecation+removal
</I>&gt;<i> process that works fine and matches the industry standard practices when
</I>&gt;<i> a code change is even suspected to matter to anyone at all. That process
</I>&gt;<i> gives far more than just 30 days to inform any interested community
</I>&gt;<i> members and does not limit the notification channels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone picks up the code removal in [1] again they should follow that
</I>&gt;<i> process 
</I>

I do not think they should. IMO, that (poorly working)
deprecation+removal process should not be used for explicit OSF/1
support removal (among other things). They should use the regular PR
review process (if we do not come up with something better by then).


&gt;<i> since that code is now obviously of some importance to reviewer Alex.
</I>
FWIW, I still[2] support removal of explicit OSF/1 support. The reason
we had this discussion is not some special importance of that explicit
OSF/1 support code. The goal is to lower the overhead of future PRs
similar to the one you closed _because_ that overhead was too high.


Hope this clarifies,

Alex.
