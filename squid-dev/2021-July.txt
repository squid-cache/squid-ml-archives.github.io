Hi , my name is BISMA i have issue related to squid whitelisting.

I have configured the whitelisting in conf file , e.g i whitelisted
facebook.com , when i open facebook in browser it opens facebook but page
dosent load css or CDN domains some images dont cosplay some text get large
, page loads improper and when i check network tab of browser it shows that
some external links facebook requires to load images and css and js like
1aplha.imgfb.com bla bla , and proxy blocks them .

How can i allow such things in whitelist as i use .facebook but it doesn't
work , im attaching my conf file in attachments.

Hi Mitesh,

    Security is a vast topic. You may get better responses from this
Squid development mailing list if you rephrase your email so that it
becomes a specific question about Squid development.

For free Squid administration support, please post to the squid-users
mailing list instead (but I would recommend rephrasing that posting to
be more specific as well):
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-users


HTH,

Alex.

Hi Bisma,

    The squid-dev list is dedicated to Squid software development. For
free Squid _administration_ support, please repost your question to the
squid-users mailing list:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-users

When you repost to squid-users, please indicate whether you are OK with
allowing _all_ accesses to sites that facebook site uses, regardless of
whether a particular request came from a client that needed the
requested resource to finish rendering a page loaded from facebook.com.


HTH,

Alex.

The Ubuntu instructions are at 
<https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/Ubuntu>.

Install the Ubuntu Squid integration scripts and packages:
   apt install squid

Install the normal Ubuntu Squid build dependencies:
   apt build-dep squid

For OpenSSL support download the libssl-dev library package as well. It 
is not one of the normal build-dep set.


Download the Squid sources you want to build.

Build those Squid sources the same as any other piece of auto-tools 
based software:
   ./configure
   make check && make install

  Use the Ubuntu-specific parameters for the ./configure command which 
are listed in the wiki page. Plus any others you want to use (eg 
--with-openssl).

The build process will tell you if there were problems.

"transparent to browsers" is not possible when TLS is involved.

The whole point of TLS is that it alerts clients (Browser etc) if/when a 
proxy touches any part of the crypto. *Especially* the TLS certificates 
or transferred data.

The Squid-users mailing list is the place to go for help using Squid.

This mailing list is for discussions about the code and people wanting 
to do some coding on Squid.
