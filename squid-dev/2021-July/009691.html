The Ubuntu instructions are at

</I>
Install the Ubuntu Squid integration scripts and packages:
   apt install squid

Install the normal Ubuntu Squid build dependencies:
   apt build-dep squid

For OpenSSL support download the libssl-dev library package as well. It 
is not one of the normal build-dep set.


Download the Squid sources you want to build.

Build those Squid sources the same as any other piece of auto-tools 
based software:
   ./configure
   make check &amp;&amp; make install

  Use the Ubuntu-specific parameters for the ./configure command which 
are listed in the wiki page. Plus any others you want to use (eg 
--with-openssl).



&gt;<i> how to find 
</I>&gt;<i> out if the package has been built successfully.
</I>
The build process will tell you if there were problems.


&gt;<i> (You need the proxy 
</I>&gt;<i> server to be transparent to browsers, that is, so that squid would 
</I>&gt;<i> generate the certificate itself).
</I>
&quot;transparent to browsers&quot; is not possible when TLS is involved.

The whole point of TLS is that it alerts clients (Browser etc) if/when a 
proxy touches any part of the crypto. *Especially* the TLS certificates 
or transferred data.



&gt;<i> I read many articles, tried to build a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your project is really very good, but it takes a titanic effort from a 
</I>&gt;<i> beginner to understand and understand it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The Squid-users mailing list is the place to go for help using Squid.

This mailing list is for discussions about the code and people wanting 
to do some coding on Squid.
