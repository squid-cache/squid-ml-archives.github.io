<PRE>Hey Alex,

I must admit that I didn't understand it enough to make sense on what specific scenario for example it will affect.
We have a set of sources for a &quot;note&quot; ie:
* &quot;note&quot; directive
* adaptation_meta directive
* annotate_transaction ACL [1]
* annotate_client ACL [1]
* adaptation services responses (eCAP and ICAP)
* helper responses

The only one I have used until today is the helpers and maybe once more with an ICAP service.

I couldn't make sense the 1+2 appended comments with the rejection RFC.
I assumed that what would happen is that if multiple helpers for example will use the same note or
a single response will contain multiple notes with the same key these will be appended.
The last time I have seen this I assumed it's in an array fashion ie multiple values compared to a single string.
I do not remember the subject enough but what I do remember is that there was an issue with
the comparison/check of a note ACL when two values were applied with the same name.

&gt;<i>From what I understood until now a single helper that will respond with multiple note_1=v note_1=v
</I>Will trigger a fatal error and I have mixed feelings about it.
However, if multiple helpers will send both each in it's turn a note_1=v these will be appended.

I agree that the result should be predictable however if logs can help to trace the issue I believe it's predicted enough
to not say about the current situation &quot;un-predictable&quot;.
I would say that since it's not a &quot;sync&quot; engine which the timing belt must not miss a &quot;beat&quot; or a &quot;tooth&quot;
It's an async engine which is far more complex.

I hope I understood the RFC and what's above it so my words will make sense of themselves.

Subject: [squid-dev] RFC: Reject repeated same-name annotations

Hello,

     I propose to adjust Squid code to reject repeated same-name 
annotations from each and every source that supplies annotations:

* &quot;note&quot; directive
* adaptation_meta directive
* annotate_transaction ACL [1]
* annotate_client ACL [1]
* adaptation services responses (eCAP and ICAP)
* helper responses

If this RFC is approved: A configuration that contains a directive with 
repeated same-name annotations will be rejected with a fatal ERROR[2]. A 
helper or service response that contains repeated same-name annotations 
will trigger a non-fatal (to Squid or transaction) cache.log ERROR[2].


Currently, Squid treats repeated same-name annotations inconsistently. 
Depending on the annotation source, Squid processing code may

* use the first same-name annotation and ignore repetitions
* use the last same-name annotation and ignore repetitions
* use all same-name annotations, honoring repetitions

These inconsistencies make it difficult to improve/enhance/optimize 
Squid code, while Squid ignorance hides misconfigurations and 
helper/service implementation bugs, including problems that may be 
related to access controls and other sensitive matters.


Any objections or better ideas?


Thank you,

Alex.

[1] In this context, we are talking about same-name annotations 
mentioned in the corresponding ACL _configuration_ (i.e. all &quot;acl&quot; 
directives with a given ACL name). A repeated _computation_ of 
annotate_foo ACL will continue to deal with same-name annotations as 
documented -- a &quot;name+=value&quot; configuration will continue to append 
values to the existing same-name annotation, while a &quot;name=value&quot; 
configuration will continue to overwrite any existing same-name annotation.

[2] Repeated same-name annotations that all have identical _values_ will 
be flagged with a WARNING instead. Some overly simplistic configuration 
generators, complicated configurations build from many include files, 
and dumb helpers/services might generate repeated same-everything 
annotations. Since such repetitions can be _safely_ ignored (honoring 
just one name=value pair among all the identical ones), we do not have 
to reject the configuration or log an ERROR because of them.
