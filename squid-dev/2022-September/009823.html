If you mean switching their build to default-enable. Sure - but there 
are often good reasons for each specific item to be default disabled today:

  * performance expensive logic
    delay pools, cache digests, adaptation

  * unavailable dependencies
   adaptation, auth sub-components

  * rarely necessary
   unlinkd, wccp, delay pools, htcp

  * buggy
   delay pools, wccp

Those reasons are also why we cannot simply remove the ./configure 
options for them (yet).


&gt;<i> We would gain:
</I>&gt;<i> - code clarity
</I>
This proposal only has a very minor gain for code clarity. The worst of 
that problem is all the #if/def looking for OS hacks/workarounds, and 
the unnecessary custom re-implementations still hanging around.


&gt;<i> - ease of development
</I>
I do no think there will be any change regarding ease. Just a different 
way of setting up the testing.


&gt;<i> - test coverage
</I>
Disagree. The default/min/max build test &quot;layers&quot; already build as many 
of these as can be tested.

Plus all the reasons Alex already stated.

&gt;<i> - feature uniformity across builds
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I agree with most of Alex points on these.

In addition, on the security side there are some passive defense 
benefits from feature obscurity and avoidance of a mono-culture for 
Squid installations.



&gt;<i> We would lose:
</I>&gt;<i> - slightly longer build time
</I>

Longer build time may not be an issue for users not building Squid 
often. But it would be compounding the already tough build farm situation.


&gt;<i> - larger binaries
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The latter should not be an issue anymore, even the most embedded of 
</I>&gt;<i> embedded systems Squid is likely to be used on has plenty of storage and 
</I>&gt;<i> core, and the former should not be too big a deal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It has been 4-5 years since I had any direct customers needing embedded 
Squid. AIUI the needs there are for software updates on hardware that 
are difficult to change (eg satellites or remote geographic outposts).
