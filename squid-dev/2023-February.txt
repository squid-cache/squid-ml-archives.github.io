Subject: [squid-dev] HTTPS Request Header acl
Message-ID: <CAFKhTfviHcjxH2r137_m2rUSAQ9cQ8nO_Py1usrDwpkSrMr3zQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I'm using Squid for my Outbound traffic filtering and I have one use case,
I'm tryning to block Egress HTTP and HTTPS Request based on certain Header
and I've also leveraged squid acl request_header_access to check and block
header, However this acl is only working for HTTP Request and not
working for HTTPS Header.

Can anyone try to help me, Does Squid have support to check & block HTTPS
Request Header?

I want to check HTTPS Request Header before the request reaches the
original destination,

Thanks,
Sanket Jaiswal
