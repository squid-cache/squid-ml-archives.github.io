I do not see a relationship: I have not tested it, but the existing 
CacheManager::ParseHeaders() code already extracts authentication 
information from cache manager requests that use &quot;http&quot; scheme AFAICT. 
Can you detail why the cachemgr_passwd directive/code cannot continue to 
work essentially as it works today after cache_object scheme support is 
removed from Squid?

Looks like we are in agreement on that.


&gt;<i> and allow admin 
</I>&gt;<i> some time to upgrade before removing the scheme support in squid itself.
</I>
Agreed. Would six months be enough in your opinion? If yes, we may be 
able to remove cache_object support in v6. Otherwise, we can remove 
cache_object support starting with v7 (as far as numbered releases are 
concerned).


&gt;<i> cachemgr.cgi should already prefer http(s) and only use cache_object 
</I>&gt;<i> as a backup.
</I>
&gt;<i> IMO the CGI tool should stay that way, supporting the scheme for older 
</I>&gt;<i> installations even after we drop it from the rest of Squid.
</I>
IMO, we should not keep any code that is only needed for Squid v3.1 and 
earlier. Squid v3.2 and later should http-based cache manager access, 
right? More code always means more maintenance overheads and higher 
change costs. Given our lack of resources, we should start ignoring 
Squid v3 needs.

Moreover, I do not see how we can keep that &quot;backup&quot; code while 
supporting newer Squids and Javascript-disabled browsers at the same 
time: AFAICT, when Javascript is disabled (or not working properly), 
that &quot;only as a backup&quot; code will send cache_object requests to modern 
Squids that will no longer support them...

I think we should upgrade that cachemgr.cgi code rather than preserve it 
for Squid v3 needs. However, if you insist, it will stay simply because 
I do not think cachemgr.cgi is worth our time.


Cheers,

Alex.
