<PRE>Hey Amos and Alex,

(Writing freely)

It's pretty simple to understand that there are two sides to the same picture so it's
possible that there are multiple scenarios.
To my understanding opening GitHub issues is not an explicit move that states any migration
from <A HREF="https://bugs.squid-cache.org/">https://bugs.squid-cache.org/</A> towards any other option.
I want to believe that developers and sysadmins are smart enough to understand a declaration
on the GitHub issues template. (Assuming they will read the text..)

In general opening an issue is nice and will probably help to work with PR's but the main question is:
Will it bring more then there is today?

However, there is another issue.
The development team will need to be watch another vector in the development cycle and I believe
that it's already not a simple task as it is.

It's better to think about any way to address both the technical and the administrative overhead
that I might suspect it will leave the development team with before the full adoption.

I believe that for now restricting the issues with an experimental statement would be enough.
If Amos feels fine with handling all the issues related syn/syn-ack/ack of any issue being opened
by himself I believe it will not harm anyone.

HTH,
Eliezer

I am against using GitHub Projects for projects that lack Squid Project 
consensus. Just like Feature pages, GitHub Projects currently create a 
false impression that the Squid Project has agreed that some activity is 
a good idea, that some details of that activity have been reviewed and 
approved by the Squid Project, and/or that some GitHub PRs match that 
good idea.

I wish you have not started using GitHub Projects before discussing that 
shared Squid Project resource use. Please pause that experiment.

</I>
Enabling GitHub Issues and then rejecting &quot;regular&quot; bug reports 
submitted via GitHub Issues is bad UX. IMO, we should either enable 
GitHub Issues for regular bug reports and other issues that folks expect 
to file via GitHub Issues (and deprecate Bugzilla) or not enable them at 
all.


HTH,

Alex.
