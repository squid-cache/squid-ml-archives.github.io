Subject: [squid-dev] Squid's mailman
Message-ID: <722656cb-9e19-4f03-b5ed-9f8bde90363c@urlfilterdb.com>

Hi all,

I posted today a message on squid-users at lists.squid-cache.org and got 2 DMARC messages (more may follow in the next 24 hours) indicating that the mail message that mailman forwards to list members is 
rejected for list members - could be many more if they block without sending a DMARC message.
It seems that the mailman software that lists.squid-cache.org uses does not obey current best practices and fails to deliver a message on the list to all subscribers where the subscriber's mail server 
does SPF checks and notices that the From header does not match with the IP address of Squid's mailman server and rejects/quarantines the message.
It could be that many messages (not just mine) do not reach the mailboxes of list subscribers.

Marcus
