Subject: [squid-dev] Feature: Bearer Authentication - Status of deployment
Message-ID: <CAGWKXQLDodxSJ=Yrhgfuv5P2X7jW+Wch_vjcQvBfLqsr2pCw6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi team, I have a question in regards to the Feature: *Bearer
Authentication* that is listed here:
https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/BearerAuthentication

Can see that it is marked with:  ?Status: nearly completed?

Just checking in on asking if there any estimation of a date when this
feature will be ready / complete ?

Any estimation would be appreciated.

Thank you,

Alexandru D

Message-ID: <fdfce1a9-fcf8-4f55-a4ae-67d2b9889c49@suse.com>

Hello,
I'm a security engineer at SUSE. I'm looking at the following security 
advisory [0] but I'm not able to identify the correct commit that fix 
the issue CVE-2023-49288 in squid 6.0.1.

I also looked at the report published at [1], the security advisory is 
linked to a "Use-After-Free in Trace Requests" vulnerability [2] but the 
mitigation suggested ("collapsed_forwarding off") for squid before 6.0.1 
doesn't prevent the crash of squid with the poc provided (this makes me 
wondering if the link between the two source are correct or they refer 
to two different bugs) (tried with squid 5.7).

Thanks a lot,
Have a nice day,

The feature is/was complete and is used by several Squid installations 
of Squid-3.5.

Parts of it have already been merged separately in current Squid. Work 
is needed to rebase the branch on current Squid and re-test it. Nobody 
is working on that at present, so no ETA is available.
