I have created a software for analyzing Squid logs (
https://github.com/kaelthasmanu/SquidStats) among other details. I would
like to publish it in the list of related software, but the form returns a
404 and is no longer accessible (
http://master.squid-cache.org/cgi-bin/related-writings-submit.pl) .

Thank you for the report of this broken form. I will look into fixing it 
shortly.

Please be aware that form is for "writings" - as in books or technical 
articles written about Squid.

For log analysis software you should use the form at
  <http://master.squid-cache.org/Misc/log-analysis.html>


I took a look at the tools documentation and noticed that it says 
"squidclient installed on the server". The squidclient tool is 
deprecated and will not be available in upcoming Squid releases.


There are also uses of the "cache_object://" URL scheme to retrieve data 
from Squid. That scheme will be rejected by all current Squid versions. 
It needs to use the "well-known" URL prefix "/squid-internal-mgr/" 
instead. Like this:
   GET http://localhost:3128/squid-internal-mgr/active_requests HTTP/1.0

(consider updating that code to support HTTP/1.1)
