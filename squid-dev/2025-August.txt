FWIW, OpenBSD has a 6 month release cycle (typically Apr/Oct, with
increasing caution as we approach the cutoff date which is a bit
variable but has usually somewhere around 5-6 weeks before recently).

Except around our release time, unless there's some issue I'll usually
pull in your latest stable fairly soon after release.

Subject: [squid-dev] Interest in Contributing to Squid Development
Message-ID: <CACGdLXeV6xxg7TZuJoLAYJM379oLugZ=AJLv9t-eHeHvZFN-6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Squid Development Team,

I hope this email reaches you safely. I'm sending it to you after viewing
the attached image. My name is Manuel, and I'm writing to express my
interest in contributing to the Squid project as a developer.

While I have little experience with C++, my primary programming languages
include C# and Python, as well as PHP and JavaScript. In my current role as
a DevOps professional, I've gained valuable experience in software
development, automation, and collaborative workflows. I'm eager to leverage
these skills to contribute to Squid in any capacity I can.

Additionally, I was the one who reported the bug (
https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5500) that I noticed on your
website and that I believe I could help resolve. I am committed to
supporting the project in any way I can, whether it be troubleshooting,
documentation, or other tasks that fit my skills.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity
to contribute to the Squid community and am excited to work with you.

Sincerely,
Manuel
