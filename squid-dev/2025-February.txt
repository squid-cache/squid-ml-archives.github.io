Subject: [squid-dev] Squid v7 has been branched today
Message-ID: <CA+Y8hcNuhTUz-WaELAc3jANNR58t1j8wxMs00bxSDDLn7CeGtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Squid developers,
  consistently with our release schedule
(https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule),
Squid v7 was branched today.

The branch is named "v7" in the squid-cache/squid GitHub repository -
https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/tree/v7

v7.0.1 beta will be released soon, all we need is PR 1988 (the ChangeLog).

Just like Squid 6.13 yesterday, it is only fitting that Squid 7 be born
at FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting

Subject: [squid-dev] Contributing to Squid and Open-Source Forward Proxy in
 Kubernetes
Message-ID: <CANZq4UBWyhXJ+t2CH3P2MfAjgx-+PEa1BBmttu9xyuwRZ5SiXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Squid Developers,

I?m Zile Rehman, a Platform Engineer
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/zile-rehman-2908b67/> at Orca Security.
Recently, I worked on a forward proxy solution in Kubernetes and found that
there are very few resources available in this area. My goal is to create
an open-source repository with a container image and clear instructions
that others can use as a forward proxy.

I?d love to get your guidance on how to get started with this initiative
and how I can contribute to the official Squid-Cache
<https://github.com/squid-cache> project.

Here?s my personal repository that I recently started: SquidFlow
<https://github.com/rehmanz/squidflow>. It?s still a work in progress, and
I plan to add more components soon.

Looking forward to your insights and suggestions!

Best Regards,
Zile Rehman

Hello Zile Rehman,

     Welcome to the Squid Project! I am not an expert on containers, but 
many folks use containerized Squid. For example, Eliezer has been 
sharing his docker files for a while as he detailed at [1,2].

As for guidance, I would recommend clearly documenting what your 
container is for: "egress proxy" is too generic. This is especially 
important if the container allows all traffic! Disclosing target use 
case(s) would also help when asking configuration questions.

Also, please note that an "acl" directive does not "allow" (or denies) 
anything. Instead, it names and defines a _condition_ (that can be used 
by other directives for various purposes, including access control). You 
may want to adjust comments inside [3] and remove unused ACLs to avoid 
confusion. If you can improve existing "acl" directive documentation 
based on your experience, please submit a pull request!
