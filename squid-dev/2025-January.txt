Ditto, Please do.


Also, To prevent regressions in future we will need to check the Anubis 
repository is not pushing more "M-staged-PR" tags on each "auto" push.

Anubis completely stopped using git tags in 2019.

Hi
I am unable to find where to download the Squid 7.x source code or git repo used for it in the new Squid web page layout that was deployed this year.
Please provide instructions on how to go about accessing it.
 https://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/ has some information on a git repo, but the 7.x version is not visible there.?I tried this week to dig and see if I could find the repo or code tar, but I was unable to find it anywhere on the site.
Please provide information on how to use the 7.x sources as I actively compile and use it on my system on a weekly/fortnightly basis.

Squid 7.x has not been released yet.
Squid's Release schedule at https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule
shows how the planned time to start the 7.x release train is next month.
What 7.x will be branched from the master branch, which you can find at
https://github.com/squid-cache/squid

Assuming you have all the libraries and tools needed to bootstrap squid
sources:

git clone https://github.com/squid-cache/squid
./bootstrap.sh
./configure (with the options you are interested in)
make

Squid v7 does not exist (yet): We have not made any v7 releases, and 
even v7 branch has not been created yet. See the following page for our 
release schedule: https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule

If you want to work with current "master" branch sources (that v7 will 
eventually be branched off), that branch is available in the official 
Squid repository located at https://github.com/squid-cache/squid

There are more details at
https://wiki.squid-cache.org/DeveloperResources/


HTH,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-dev] Confirmation of Feature Support of HTTP/2
Message-ID: <17775fc1fa72495fad6d43da9b83aac8@3ds.com>

Hi Team,


Curious about support for HTTP/2 for traffic flowing through the squid proxy and found the following article which seems to be a bit old so wanted to confirm.


https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTP2


Does the latest version support either this or HTTP/3? If not, are there plans to have this supported in the next release? Thank you for your time and have a good day.


Regards,

Hi Christian,

     No, Squid v6 does not support HTTP/2+.


> are there plans to have this supported in the next release?

No, and there is not enough time to change that because the next release 
branch -- Squid v7 -- should be created (and more-or-less become 
off-limits for major refactoring changes) in about ten days:
https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule

FWIW, there are plans to have HTTP/3 and/or HTTP/2 support in Squid v8, 
but several major code changes are required _before_ we can start 
working on HTTP/2+ support, and I cannot promise anything about v8 
release today due to insufficient cooperation among core developers.


HTH,

Alex.

I am puzzled by your question because I have already answered it in the 
email you quote below. Please see the paragraph that starts with "FWIW, 
there are plans to have HTTP/3 and/or HTTP/2 support in Squid v8".

The need for HTTP/2+ support is known, and there are plans to address 
that need. Please see my earlier response (quoted below) for details.


Thank you,

Alex.

Hi Alex,


Thank you for the feedback and clarification. Are there any plans of supporting other HTTP protocol revisions such as HTTP/2 for future releases? If not, what process can we follow to submit a request for this to be considered in the future?

Hi Christian,

     No, Squid v6 does not support HTTP/2+.


> are there plans to have this supported in the next release?

No, and there is not enough time to change that because the next release
branch -- Squid v7 -- should be created (and more-or-less become
off-limits for major refactoring changes) in about ten days:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule__;!!FbCVDoc3r24SyHFW!6t-CzQPmCvwXxBPtE6HFyU3SPn3z2Of2DvIOuFLmDkmfoGujkQxb6XMok7jKWOhzVCnwAV9Ma4wT70Tr0ov_V7rvCw8Stg$[wiki[.]squid-cache[.]org]

FWIW, there are plans to have HTTP/3 and/or HTTP/2 support in Squid v8,
but several major code changes are required _before_ we can start
working on HTTP/2+ support, and I cannot promise anything about v8
release today due to insufficient cooperation among core developers.


HTH,

Alex.
