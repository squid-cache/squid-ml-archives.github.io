Subject: [squid-dev] Squid v8 release schedule proposal
Message-ID: <CA+Y8hcNkXSbj6-RE2-xAukcn9jWGj3atjs+6uuZEeY_Wx-VYbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
  Now that v7 out of beta, it's time to start thinking about v8.

Unfortunately we released too late to make it into Debian forky. V7 is
in sid/unstable, but the next stable will ship v6.13.
Ubuntu 25.10 ("questing") is also carrying 6.13 at this time.

I've asked the Debian maintaner a tentative timeline for getting
squid-8 included in the next stable version of Debian, he mentioned a
likely target is to be out of beta by january 2027. Working backwards,
I propose to set the date for forking v8 in early October 2026.

Thoughts?

FTR; The release cycle of our major vendor ecosystems are:

  * Debian has a 2 year major release approximately Jun-Aug on 
odd-numbered years. With a 6:12:18 month 'update' release where Squid 
might be eligible to change if there are major benefits demonstrable.

  * Ubuntu has 6-monthly release cycle (Apr/Aug) and bi-annual Apr 
becomes a LTS for 10-15 years. Whatever Squid is in Debian Testing a few 
months prior to their release will be provided.

  * Debian/Ubuntu derivative OS will either match, or follow by 1-2 
years and thus at least one Squid major version. Most accept install of 
newer Debian/Ubuntu packages for more up-to-date Squid installs.

  * Fedora has release cycles every 6 months (+/- some weeks). So easily 
tracks whichever Squid release.

  * RHEL has a 5-year release cycle. Whichever Squid version was in 
Fedora **5 years prior** will be provided. A semi-official 'backports' 
is used to track whichever Squid version is in Fedora with up to a year 
delay.

  * NetBSD has a 2-3 year release cycle. With 6-monthly updates pulling 
in Squid latest stable as-needed.

  * Gentoo and derivatives are all rolling release. They track our 
stable release cycle with a few weeks QA delays at each subsequent level 
of OS derivative.

  * The remainder of the vendor ecosystems are proprietary or volunteer 
based with ad-hoc delays based on their community interest in latest Squid.

My old v3-v5 release cycles of Sep fork/beta and Feb stable were aimed 
at meeting these regular Debian/Ubuntu release cycles. Which is 
convenient timing for most of the major ecosystems - excluding RHEL 
which cannot meet our short cycle anyway.


Convenience for Alex and Measurement Factory was the biggest driver for 
changing to Feb forking and Jul release.

FWIW, branching and release months have no particular impact or 
"convenience" for me and The Measurement Factory.
