Hi Markus and everyone,

The HTTPbis WG over at IETF has brought up the topic of
(Proxy-)Authentication-Info headers usage and syntax.

I recall Squid uses it for Negotiate in non-standard ways, and see that
our use actually violates what little syntax definition does exist. But
not the why of it.

Do anyone know why it is being emitted by Squid at all?

And are there any known clients out there using it?

(ie can we drop or change to a compliant form without trouble?)

Amos
