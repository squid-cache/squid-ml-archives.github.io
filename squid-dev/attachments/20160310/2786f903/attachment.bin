Ensure any previous HttpRequest objects on AccessLogEntry are unlocked, to ensure they don't leak memory.

With this change, all current assignments to al->request and
al->adapted_request are guarded by either a nullptr check, or by
HTTPMSGUNLOCK()'ing the previous request object first.

This is submitted on behalf of Bloomberg L.P.
