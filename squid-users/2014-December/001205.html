<PRE>Hello Brendan,

I would suggest looking at any ICAP server(s) to perform web filtering and AV; some docs how to build a chain of ICAP servers together to achieve at least some of your goals are at <A HREF="http://docs.diladele.com/faq/squid.html#is-it-possible-to-add-anti-virus-scanning-to-diladele-web-safety.">http://docs.diladele.com/faq/squid.html#is-it-possible-to-add-anti-virus-scanning-to-diladele-web-safety.</A>

The list of available ICAP servers is <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Misc/icap.html.">http://www.squid-cache.org/Misc/icap.html.</A>

But I am biased so these are just my two very personal cents.

Best regards,

Subject: [squid-users] what are people using nowadays (icap, a/v, etc)?

i have been running Squid with DansGuardian, ClamAV and Privoxy for quite some time, and have been successful and moderately pleased with functionality and performance.

while DG has been a means for me to perform A/V scanning at the infrastructure layer via ClamAV, the penalty has been losing HTTP/1.1 compression and cache controls.  because DG downgrades everything to HTTP/1.0, i feel i am not getting the most out of my squid instance (through no fault of the software, or those who write/support it).

i am looking to move with the times, and find out what people are using these days.  c-icap seems to use libclamav for scanning, which would suffice, but it is not available on fedora as an rpm in repos, it seems.
i would much prefer to have rpms from repos that are updated then have to install packages that i rolled myself.

libecap is available, but i dont know if i need more than just that to do a/v scanning.  squidguard, also is available, but that does not look like it interfaces with clamav.

what are people using these days, and what feedback do you have on the setup you have?
