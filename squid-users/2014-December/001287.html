Worse than that - I'm mainly thinking ssh (which won't survive DPI).

&gt;<i> Port 443 is specifically registered for &quot;HTTP over TLS&quot; (aka HTTPS).

</I>&gt;<i> SPDY, QUIC, COAP, even IRC and Jabber at times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other non-HTTP protocols have other non-443 ports registered or

My point isn't even about &quot;lazy corporates&quot;  but this: how many airlines
will block ssh over port 22 and how many will block it over 443? (And if
that doesn't work OpenVPN on 443 and ssh through that) I assume Google
thought along similar lines when they talked about which port to put their
binary Drive data on.

You want people to stop using 443 for non-https traffic, get people to stop
blocking the other ssl ports.

This is OT but here's the topical point -  if you're going to bump http+ssl
traffic, you need to know that due to some people blocking alternative
ports for secure services, you'll always see non-http traffic here. The
IETF might give you a port but only smart long term business decisions will
allow you to keep it - that's far past over for 443/tcp at this point I
think :/
