Sorry, I should have said that if I remove the iptables 443 redirect
rule, it still occurs!

Ah! Yeah - nasty

So you're saying this is expected behaviour? Squid with HTTPS intercept
enabled is vulnerable to DoS attacks with a simple 3-way?

Now that you have explained it to me, I can see the issue, but I think
squid needs to do something about it. eg when squid starts it could make
a note of all it's own IP addresses:ports, then if someone asks squid to
connect to those combinations, reject it. There is no valid case where
squid should ever be used to connect to itself that I can think of

I just made the following changes

acl localSquidServer    src 127.0.0.1 proxy.ip.address
deny_info ERR_LOCALSQUID    localSquidServer
http_access deny localSquidServer

Now when I connect to the HTTP (not https!) intercept port, I see the
html error page ERR_LOCALSQUID - great - works like it says on the box.
However, that deny doesn't trigger for https (it's the first http_access
entry BTW). Shouldn't that be a mechanism to filter this DoS out? If
not, shouldn't there be &quot;https_access&quot; to achieve the same thing? I also
tried using iptables to exclude such connections, but my proxy is my
default gateway and I couldn't come up with a rule that worked without
breaking redirection all together.

&gt;<i> A proper HTTP client software like squidclient, wget, curl, or even a
</I>&gt;<i> full browser should be used.
</I>
I explicit mentioned telnet (nc is the same) because it means it
triggers on any successful TCP 3-way handshake - no data needs to flow
for the fault to trigger. If I call &quot;curl <A HREF="http://proxy.server:3127">http://proxy.server:3127</A>&quot; it
also triggers the runaway CPU (3127 being my https intercept port of
course).

Thanks
