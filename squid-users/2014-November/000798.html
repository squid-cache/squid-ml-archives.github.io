<PRE>Hi All,

For my configuration to use the ssl bump, I am setting the number of sslcrtd_children to 50. But in the documentation it is written that   &quot;The maximum this may be safely set to is 32&quot; . When I set it to 32, I am getting warning that all 32/32 helpers are busy, consider increasing the number of helpers. So I increased it to 50 and the warnings are no longer appearing. So is it safe to fix  the number of sslcrtd helpers to 50?I am aware that this setting may take more resources compared to the recommended one. Also  is there any restriction from the squid code/implementation on the maximum number of sslcrtd children?

Please find below the configuration line.

sslcrtd_children 50 startup=5 idle=1

Thanks in Advance,
John
