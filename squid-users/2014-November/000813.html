<PRE>I was showing my students the process of using a squid server and building 
linux kernels. Have done this in the past, but today it didn't work the same.
The squid server is setup differently, so there may be something I missed in 
setting up the parent that caused the difference.

In the past, it was just a local squid server, and would cache on the same 
1000M network of my classroom. 192.168.7.0 with squid server on 
192.168.7.3. But had changed the configuration to use one of our ISPs proxy 
server as a parent due to geographic issues. When doing updates using our 
local college IP addresses, we would connect to Austrial and/or New Zealand 
repos that are really slow from Guam. The one ISP has a squid server at 
proxy.guam.net and allows us to use it, and it has a US based address, so it 
connects to US sites which are much faster. 

Normally, I would download the file on a machine locally, so it was in the 
local squid servers cache, but now that it uses the ISPs server as a parent, it 
didn't seem to cache the file on the local server, but only on the ISPs server. 
Instead of downloading the file via the local server via 1000M connection, it 
seemed to be downloading multiple copies through the 20M connection to 
the ISP taking about 30 minutes with about 10 machines downloading the 
70+M 3.17.3 kernel file from kernel.org?

Is there an option that would have the local squid server cache a file locally 
thru the parent so other request would come from the local squid server.

Thanks.
