</I>
During one TCP session from browser to Squid, I see requests both with
and without the Proxy-Authorization header. The requests without the
Proxy-Authorization header are also satisfied by the proxy. I don't
understand the logic behind this, that's why I am asking.

If there were a Proxy-Authorization header on every request, or only
on the first request in a TCP session, or if every credentialless
request were followed by a 407, I would not be surprised.

&gt;<i> They are not a pair. Since there is no requirement for anything to
</I>&gt;<i> follow the 407. Nor is there even a requirement for the two messages
</I>&gt;<i> to be sent on the same TCP connection (eg &quot;auth_param ... keep_alive
</I>&gt;<i> off&quot;). Statelessness is fun sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the connection is used for several requests, only the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP request in the connection would contain authentication info.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No. Once authentication is accepted on a connection the credentials
</I>&gt;<i> token MUST be sent on all following requests.
</I>
However, as I am looking at a single TCP session between squid and browser
(filtered out by WireShark), I don't see this happening. The 407 reply is sent
only once, and then there are some requests following, some of them
contain the Proxy-Authorization header but most don't.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - So far that is basic HTTP auth requirements. Now things get weird...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lack of Negotiate credentials on any request is a sign of injection
</I>&gt;<i> attack being performed and the TCP connection must be torn down.
</I>
There are plenty of such requests in the packet dump, and they are
happily answered with a &quot;200 OK&quot; and relevant content.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To do that tear-down Squid can send 407 challenge with
</I>&gt;<i> Connection:close such that the client can resume with
</I>&gt;<i> re-authentication on new TCP connection(s) without waiting for any 407.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But each new TCP connection is re-authenticated by HTTP. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not really. A TCP connection may be used for multiple requests before
</I>&gt;<i> one needs to authenticate and kicks out a 407.
</I>
But each request, you say, must contain the credentials? Well, it does
not seem to be happening.
