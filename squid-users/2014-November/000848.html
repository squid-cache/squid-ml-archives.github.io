<PRE>HTML version at: <A HREF="http://www1.ngtech.co.il/repo/release-3.4.9.html">http://www1.ngtech.co.il/repo/release-3.4.9.html</A>
I am happy to release the new RPMs of squid 3.4.9 and 3.5.0.2 beta for
Centos 6.6 64bit.
The new release includes couple bug fixes and improvements.
The links to the RPMs are at the bottom of the article.

&#8220;The sales man&#8221;
You get into a shop.. you got a sales man.
You have a meeting, you got a sales man + IT guy.
For a very long time I tried to understand the sales man place in the
shoe store
and in the IT area but it always was a mystery to me.
Some think that the sales man is the one that his job is to take some
product from
the inventory and put it in your hands and make sure you will pay for it.
Others thinks that his job is to make sure you will pay or at least will
think about it.
So in any case it's a very hard job!
I never have been a salesman but I have seen lots and lots of them.
There was a nice guy here and there but I will never forget &#8220;The sales
man&#8221;!!
Indeed I must admit it is a rare character to find but &#8220;The sales man&#8221;
do exist.
The one that wants your own good and to not just put anything in your hands.
I was very surprised to understand that even though his job was to sell
he told me
&#8220;I don't want you to buy the product! It's not for you!&#8221;.
I know some think it might be a myth but &#8220;The sales man&#8221; is a very nice
guy which wants your own good.
There are crooks or bullies but non of them are real sales man.
These are crooks and always will be named this way.

For example if I will want to buy a new cell phone I will want him
to first understand my needs and according to these offer me what
he has and tell me if he doesn't have what I am looking for.
I expect this since I had a very good experience with more then one
of these sales man in the past.
I was looking for this type of sales man for many years until not long ago
and then I have found one.
I gladly asked him in a very honest way &#8220;Is this the way you sell
everybody?&#8221;
without any hesitation he answered me &#8220;Yes I am!!!&#8221;.
He showed me how he sells to couple customers and
I was fascinated by &#8220;The art of the sales man&#8221;.
He actually could sell a brick wall something but he just couldn't do that.
When I asked him about the reason he is not selling a Popsicle to Eskimos
he started to ask me couple questions and eventually told me
&#8220;I do not want to sell anything to anyone since I do not want others to
sell me anything the same way&#8221;.
This is one of the extraordinary things I have learned from &#8220;The sales man&#8221;.

* Any notes and comments are wanted and welcome!

= RPMs release notifications
For now the RPM for the new release has started.
I have built until now two RPMs one for 3.4.9 stable and the other for
3.5.0.2 beta.
There are three packages:
- squid-%version%.rpm which contains the squid binary
- squid-helpers-%version%.rpm which contains the squid helpers
- squid-debuginfo-%version%.rpm which contains the debug symbols for the
other packages

For now the RPMs was built only for 64 bit version of CentOS 6.6 but
later as the time allows me I will build also for 32 bit CentOS 6.6 and
oracle linux 64 bit.

In this beta release I have tested:
- basic RPM installation
- simple forward proxy usage
- basic large rock functionality (creation, storage, recovery from
couple cases)
