Here are some tips for your patterns:

* all the (.+\.)? at the begining are useless complication. Remove.

* so are the .*?$ at the end of some patterns. This bit is also
probably doing more harm than good. Because the $ hints to regex that
it should scan right-to-left and the path and query portions of the
URL is the largest pieces to scan over. Remove.

* the following two lines are redundant. The first will match
everything the second would have caught. Drop the second one.

  refresh_pattern -i \.htm 120 50% 10080 reload-into-ims
  refresh_pattern -i \.html 120 50% 10080 reload-into-ims

* the pattern below the comment &quot;#Very aggressive 120 Days&quot; contains
duplicates.


there are probably some smaller fixes, but those are the biggest I can
see without suggesting you drop those patterns entirely.

You would do well from an upgrade of Squid. The later versions have
eliminated the need for ignore-no-cache, ignore-private, ignore-auth
(the latter two there do really, really bad things).

I am also curios why you are ignoring must-revalidate? it is a
bandwidth reduction mechanism.
