<PRE>Hello,

AFAIK it is possible to use redocks software (
<A HREF="http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/">http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/</A> ) with squid.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Kind of. You need:
</I>&gt;<i> . An appropriate rule in iptables nat table that ends with -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3129 (or whatever port you are listening on for this traffic)
</I>&gt;<i> . A https_port definition in squid.conf on that port with ssl-bump and a certificate (certificate doesn't get used unless you are doing actual https but the syntax requires it) and a port name
</I>&gt;<i> . an acl attached to the name of the listeners myportname
</I>&gt;<i> . an ssl_bump none that matches the traffic you are interested in (all if you aren't doing https interception)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that you know you can do it, consider:
</I>&gt;<i> . I've asked this question on the list and the response from people who really do know what they are talking about is that squid is not designed as a general tcp proxy and there are probably other solutions that work better
</I>&gt;<i> . squid currently doesn't allow a sensible termination of the connection if it isn't allowed, or if there is nothing listening at the other end. Your smtp/pop3/imap/etc application won't like that.
</I>&gt;<i> . you have to do authentication out-of-band (eg ident), but that's the same with transparent http anyway
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To do this really nicely, squid would need:
</I>&gt;<i> . a &quot;tcp_port&quot; instead of &quot;http_port&quot; designed for exactly this sort of thing
</I>&gt;<i> . a way to call out to the destination before accepting the connection so that a 'connection refused' could be given if there is nothing listening
</I>&gt;<i> . a way to simply drop the connection if it doesn't succeed rather than the default response squid gives
</I>&gt;<i> . a way to redirect traffic to a helper (eg SMTP/IMAP/POP3 filter to scan for viruses, etc) (maybe this already exists already via other means?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in short it works, but not as well as it could, and you might be better of finding another solution. The main reason I was interested is that Squid already has a very nice acl implementation, and there are already a number of good log analysis tools for it.
