The CA system itself is the design flaw. No I would not go so far as
to say &quot;bug&quot; (thats code) but &quot;loophole&quot; and &quot;flaw&quot; are more
appropriate for a system design problem.

The intention and design of TLS/SSL is to prevent third-party
intermediaries (is Squid) inntercepting communications (is ssl-bump)
and looking at what the traffic inside is. Anything that lets a third
party access is by definintion a flaw in the TLS protocol design.

Yes, cert pinning, HSTS, hard coded google.com CA certificates ...
whatever they can think of next.

MSIE 11 seems to be growing in popularity for some reason ;-)
