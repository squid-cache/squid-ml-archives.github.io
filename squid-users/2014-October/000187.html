The dodgy &quot;invisibly tracking users without them knowing it&quot; feature
that NTLM auth gives you only works for MSIE (all other browsers prompt
I think?) and is much slower than Basic. Yes Basic does prompt, but the
user can &quot;save&quot; the password (ie they only do it once) and is much
cleaner and more reliable (try running multi-domain NTLM where one of
the domains is a continent away). Basic is quicker because it's embedded
in the HTTP transaction on a 1-for-1 basis, whereas NTLM is 1-for-4 (I
think?). ie you have to make 4 HTTP requests before you get the webpage
when you use NTLM (ignoring keepalive)

The only downside (besides your users knowing you're tracking them...)
is that Basic is cleartext - so sniffers can see the passwords. However,
if it's on a corporate network, that shouldn't be a problem (else you're
doing it wrong ;-)

I prefer Basic specifically because it *does* mean the users know you're
tracking them: that means they're less likely to go to dodgy sites/etc
on company time :-)
