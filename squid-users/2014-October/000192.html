Yes several things. Basically SG does not contain all of the hacks and
disablings necessary to cope with demands NTLM places on HTTP proxies.
Which is reasonable since its design goal is to filter HTTP traffic.

&gt;<i>

</I>
In which case there should be no need for you to have SG at all.

The popular blocklist/blacklist sources for SG also provide Squid
format downloads of the same lists, or converters are easily written.

</I>
I am the one driving that effort at present. It is a side hobby on my
overall goal of feature parity between Squid-2 and Squid-3 - keeping
Squid building and running on any OS Squid-2 was useful for.

The official state of Squid on Windows is documented in here:
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/Windows">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/Windows</A>
the newest bits are down under &quot;Porting Efforts&quot; for now.

Changes as they are found are being applied directly on the mainstream
3.HEAD version. So the regular 3.HEAD ChangeLog and bugzilla are used
to track minor changes and issues.

Summary:
So far I have MinGW-w64 executables of Squid-3.5 that produce &quot;Error
127&quot;. yay!. Any assistance figuring out what I have done wrong to get
that is welcome. So far I think its a missing DLL or wrong .exe
settings going into the compiler.

Visual Studio 2012 builds are also ongoing, but will not be available
until the Foundation provides an upstream git repository (being planned).

Personal donations welcome (&lt;<A HREF="http://treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/">http://treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/</A>&gt;),
but due to the above error 127 I am disinclined to accept contracts
with anything like a deadline.
