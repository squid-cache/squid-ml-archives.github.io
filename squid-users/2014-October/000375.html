What do you mean by &quot;defined in squid.conf&quot;? What statements?

and, what does your squid.conf contain already?

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> static route has 0.0.0.0 as its gateway address.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That should not affect ping/ICMP.


&gt;<i> See the below config for one of the remote sites:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> iptunnel add tun-cc mode gre remote 192.168.253.16 local

</I>&gt;<i> 10.80.202.0/23 dev tun-cc metric 101
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Remote 192.168.253.16 ??
That might be the problem. How does 192.168.* traffic get routed over
the Internet to remote endpoint?


&gt;<i> In squid.conf, this network should be considered internal: acl

</I>&gt;<i> 0 0          0 eth0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, the gateway for this remote site is the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> (0.0.0.0)
</I>
No. That is link-local &quot;gateway&quot;. As in: this machine thinks it is has
a direct cable/wireless connection to all machines in that netblock -
maybe a un-managed switch or hub on between but nothing more. Thus no
gateway router is needed to contact them.

The way to things on Internet is unknown and complex, thus a gateway
(10.80.166.254) is needed to manage routing those packets around.

Looks correct to me like that routing table is correct, even if you
are misunderstanding it.


NP: the tun-cc should be wrapping the packets in a tunnel wrapper IP
that can traverse the network/Internet between this machine and the
other end of the tunnel. Just as if the tunnel were a single &quot;wire&quot;.


&gt;<i> and thinking it should be 10.80.166.254. When I try to change the
</I>&gt;<i> gateway for this static route, I get message - RTNETLINK answers:
</I>&gt;<i> File exists If I remove the static route, I cannot get to any
</I>&gt;<i> internal or Internet site from a remote site workstation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Due to the ASA in the traffic path of the remote sites, there is a
</I>&gt;<i> gre tunnel setup for outbound traffic from the Squid server,
</I>&gt;<i> without the tunnel the packet would be dropped by the ASA box.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know the best practices is to have a proxy server at each remote
</I>&gt;<i> location, but this solution does work for most requests. Has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> else run into this and found a solution, thanks....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

This is what I think is happening:

 * &quot;normal&quot; traffic from Squid is destined to Internet servers, thus
has Squid 10.* src-IP and some global dst-IP. These go out via eth0 to
the ASA and get routed (and NAT?) applied normally.

 * the internal traffic to remove POP (including ping?) attempts to go
out the tunnel, and gets wrapped as src-IP 10.80.166.227 with dst-IP
192.168.253.16. Then sent out eth0 to the ASA.
   - something blocks/drops those packets ?
