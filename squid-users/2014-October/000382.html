<PRE>Hi.

</I>&gt;<i> Which of the ways is correct, in your opinion? Could you repeat?
</I>To my knowledge, RC4 should fit, because newer versions add only aes 
cipher suites.
&gt;<i> Which was your situation when the article helped?
</I>I had a situaltion when there were lots ot e-types errors between non-R2 
w2k3 and w7 workstations. Plus, my keytab was only for RC4 only. Plus, I 
had duplicate SPNs and wrong understanding about how the kerberos 
exchange is working and what principal name is requested when (yours 
seems to be correct, though). I played with &quot;use only DES&quot; setting for a 
troubled user in AD, played with msDS-SupportedEncrytionTypes in AD, but 
due to all the complications this didn't help. So, I eliminated  w2k3 by 
changing it to the w2k3r2 dc, - this didn't help by itself, so I had to 
clear out other errors. Then my setup started to work. Unfortunately, I 
don't have an answer to the question &quot;what is needed for squid to work 
in a kerberos environment with different generation OSes&quot;. I also didn't 
get KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error. I can say that if we talk about w7 
coexistance with the w2k3 domain controller - no critical errors were 
seen, so workstations could log in to the AD domain just fine.

I would propose to you to conduct some tests pointing your squid setup 
to some modern DC, if you have one, and see if this error would disappear.

Eugene.
