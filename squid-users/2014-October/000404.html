Hash: SHA1

The Squid Software Foundation is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid-3.5.0.1 beta release!

   Thats right! The Squid Software Foundation is now formally
   in place as copyright representative (Squid remains GPLv2+
   with hundreds of individual copyright holders), and operator
   for the infrastructure used to assemble and publish this and
   later Squid versions.


This new 3.5 series of Squid brings useful new features and changes
providing improved performance over earlier release series.

More detailed descriptions of the major new features are available in
the release notes and wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html</A>
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-3.5">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-3.5</A>

Detailed lists of the ./configure build and squid.conf changes can also
be found in the release notes.

This code is released as beta for wider testing purposes and potential
use. There are no more planned alterations to the existing features,
./configure options or squid.conf options.


All users of Squid-2.7 held back because of the Collapsed Forwarding
feature will be happy to know it has finally been ported in this
release. Please upgrade ASAP.


All developers of eCAP plugins need to be aware this release of Squid
supports libecap 1.0. This brings with it an end to some complications
plugins built against older libecap library versions had. This version
has some backward compatibility support, but plugins really should be
rebuilt against the new library for reliable behaviour.


Squid is now capable of accepting native FTP commands at an ftp_port
and relaying native FTP messages between FTP clients and FTP servers.
Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not currently work with native
FTP proxying, and many features have not even been tested for
compatibility.


Authentication helpers can now be passed arbitrary details in addition
to the credentials required for the HTTP authentication scheme.
 PLEASE NOTE: care needs to be taken when using this feature, it
*will* cause an increase in load on the authentication system
proportional to the variability of the extra details sent. In short,
it bypasses Squids' built-in DDoS and credential replay protection.
 The Store-ID and URL-rewrite helper interfaces are also extended with
matching abilities.


The Digest authentication, Store-ID, and URL-rewrite helpers packaged
with Squid have been updated to support concurrency channels. They
will auto-detect the channel-ID field and will produce the appropriate
response format. With these helpers concurrency may now be set to 0 or
any higher number as desired.
 Developers of third-party helpers still needing concurrency support
are encouraged to take a look and see how this auto-detection is done
for each interface. Concurrency on these interfaces is scheduled to be
enabled by default in a future release.


Named Services has now been extended to be available on all operating
systems, it has previously been a Windows-only feature. It restores
the ability to run multiple instances on the same machine even when
SMP support is being used. The squid.conf ${service_name} macro is
also added to simplify configuration file management.
 The ability intentionally includes some backward compatibility.
Whereas older Squid-3 SMP-aware versions may only have one instance of
themselves running in total, this feature allows the new version to
run alongside an older version by using a different service name.


Initial support for PROXY protocol, a more portable alternative to
X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded HTTP headers has been added in this
version. Currently only http_port uses the protocol wrapper to receive
traffic from a peer proxy or gateway device.


The squidclient tool has been through a minor overhaul in this version.
 Anyone utilizing its ability to 'ping' an HTTP server for uptime
monitoring need to be aware the command line options have now been
changed.
 HTTPS is now also supported if the GnuTLS library was available when
building Squid. OpenSSL-only builds of the tool do not have this feature.
 Run 'squidclient -h' for a quick summary of options or see the
Release Notes for more details.


Operating System support:

* Windows support has in recent times worked its way back into view
with both MinGW and Cygwin builds showing some success. Windows is now
being considered a supported OS again. So any and all assistance
building, testing and bug reports welcome. Just be aware that as this
is all a recent event Squid-3 as a whole is still considered beta on
this OS.

 * MacOS X is at risk of ending up in the sad situation Windows is
just vacating. Due to breakage in the shared memory API needed by
Squid for SMP support, along with a lack of interest from the MacOS
community in getting it fixed. If Squid on Mac is of importance to you
some assistance getting over that blocker problem is welcomed.


Major features dropped:
 * COSS support is officially purged from the code.

Rock store has been available for several versions, with COSS
operation broken for even longer. This version brings &gt;32KB object
support to Rock store and thus removes the last potential need for COSS.

 * DNS helper API and dnsserver are officially purged from the code.

mDNS support has been available since Squid-3.4 and has no bug reports
across the entire series. Thus passing our criteria for stable, and
demonstrating the lack of need for the DNS helper.


All users are encouraged to give this Squid release a test run as soon
as time permits. All feedback welcome.
