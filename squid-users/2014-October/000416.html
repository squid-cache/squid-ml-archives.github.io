<PRE>Hello Amos,

For squid 3.4.8, In the server we have 2xssd 240GB and 4XHDD 2000GB, Internet bandwidth 600Mbits and four squid instances, please what is the suggestion settings for cache_dir for SSD and HDD to cover the high http traffic request.

Thank you and Best Regards,
Saleh

In summary: &quot;The latest you can get&quot; (aka 3.4.8)


The long answer:

<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/</A> has the answers you seek about
what Squid versions are most current &quot;stable&quot;.

 That page says &quot;Stable releases&quot; -&gt; 3.4,

 clicking the &quot;3.4&quot; link goes to a page saying:
   &quot;Latest 3.4 series release&quot; -&gt; 3.4.8.

(** we are having trouble with some of our mirror servers at present,
please check the final page says 3.4.8. If not refresh or use
west.squid-cache.org domain name. **)


Squid-3 has many packages because we have a monthly release schedule.
All releases with two dots (x.y.z) are considered production ready
&quot;stable&quot; releases. For any x.y series the higher the z number the better.

So ... most of the time you should pick the one with latest number at
the time when installing (the versions and package download pages can
help there). Then can choose to stay with it (aka &quot;stable&quot; unchanging)
until something major requires an upgrade, or you can follow the
releases and stay on top of all sorts of small issues. Each month in
the announcement I try to highlight what sort of criteria you need to
consider when deciding.

As of today the current &quot;stable&quot; is Squid-3.4.8, and there is also a
Squid-3.5.0.1 beta for people wanting to try out some cool new
features from the upcoming 3.5 series.



Regarding your Question:

 * all the Squid versions 3.2 or later can handle more traffic than
what Squid-2.7 could. Performance is a constant topic of ongoing
improvement.

 * all releases since the *minimum* Squid package number (3.1.*) named
in the TPROXYv4 wiki page support TPROXYv4.

&gt;<i> what is alternative for &quot;COSS&quot; in squid-3 for small index object
</I>&gt;<i> for the high http traffic request.
</I>
 * Rock storage type has replaced COSS. That is a feature added in
Squid-3.2 series.

Although be aware the Squid-3.2 to Squid-3.4 series rock storage is
limited by shared-memory design to only store 32KB or smaller objects.
This is sufficient for most use-cases.

If you have some important need for &gt;32KB sized objects to be in the
Rock store, you will need to use the 3.5 series (currently beta) where
that limit has been removed.
