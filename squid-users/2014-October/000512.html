<PRE>Hi Amos , thank you.

I just wanted to explain something

Now , im okay without SMP , I can save bandwidth and its fine...but cores are not balanced and that may lead some cpu cores reach 100 %

But...... I need to use SMP with large rock to save bandwidth .... now it works fine ...but no saving !!
Im using 3.4.7 stable 

What I need is ,
Someone used 3.head and found a result of saving bandwith.....as an example wt max cache size and mem size allow in large rock ?


That wt I need .... I need a fast browsing squid  that can save my bandwidth.
Amos , can u guide me with a 3.head verison you used with large rock and gave you thr best results of saving bandwidth ???

regards

The disk store limit depends on HDD/SSD space available. That goes for all cache_dir types.


What do you mean by &quot;ram store&quot; ?

 IIRC, rock storage does away with the split memory/disk &quot;slices&quot;
which were used in COSS. So there is no tricky management of how many slices are in memory and swapping in/out.

 Squid has a RAM store (cache_mem) which is not particularly related to Rock storage. You need to tune that cache_mem size around how much RAM is used for all cache_dir existing, and active transaction needs.
Nobody can tell you the answer since the administrative &quot;test, measure, tune&quot; process is the only way to find it.

Details required. &quot;hangs after some time&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are very vague.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need  a help with a squid large rock  best practice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The feature is still in beta. As an early adopter you are one of the people whose feedback will define what the best practice in future will be.

Despite being *capable* of large object storage rock is optimal for small objects. UFS/AUFS/diskd cache types are optimal for large objects - except no SMP sharing there yet which is just annoying.

For now the regular best practice for cache_dir in general applies. To ensure you have enough RAM for cache index (10-15MB er GB of cached
data) not to cause memory swapping, to ensure you do not exceded available disk space, etc. etc.
