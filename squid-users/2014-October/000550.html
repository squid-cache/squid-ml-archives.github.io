Perhapse it is a result of the arms-race happening in the SSL/TLS
area. Try upgrading to the latest Squid-3.5 and see if the bumping
features there help. We know for certain that the ssl-bump features in
3.2 and 3.3 are useless with a growing number of websites using HSTS
and &quot;cert-pinning&quot;.


But I dont think it is that clearly &quot;on them&quot;. Interception *is* an
attack on your users, and illegal in a lot of cases as well. It is
reasonable for them not to support it.

You are the first person noticably involved with MacOS / iOS in any
way to post anything here in a long while. So unless you get a direct
the answer assume it is &quot;none of us use iOS like this&quot;.
