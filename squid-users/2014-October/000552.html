For HTTP yes. For other protocols no.

Ensure that persistent connections to clients and servers is enabled
and Squid will multiples HTTP traffic as much as possible on outgoing
connections.

You are assuming two things that are possibly incorrect.

Firstly, that there is intentional throttling happening at all.
 - If you have a large amount of traffic on a DSL line it is more
likely to be simple network congestion.

Secondly, that it is happening based on number of connections.
 - Active throttling is more likely to be based on total bytes
transferred. It is simpler to implement for ISP and has the same
management effects.

Squid can also help somewhat with either of those situations by
caching HTTP responses and reducing the upstream HTTP bandwidth used.

The more current your Squid version the better it will be able to do
on both persistent connection re-use, caching and HTTP/1.1 bandwidth
optimizations.
