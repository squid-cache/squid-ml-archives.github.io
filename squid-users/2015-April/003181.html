I doubt it unless you are in control of the sites the users are 
visiting. When a page is loaded, the browser instructs the OS to open a 
TCP connection to download the page. When all the data has been 
downloaded, the TCP connection becomes idle and after a short time the 
OS will close it.

If the sites are yours I suppose you could add some JS that would get 
the browser to repeatedly make a request to the site with a 
page-specific ID so you could track how long they were on that page.

Cheers

Alex
