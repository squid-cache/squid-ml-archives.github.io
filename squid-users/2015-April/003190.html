Nope. Best you will achieve is a guesstimate.

HTTP is stateless protocol. There is no such thing as close (or open).
The only thing anywhere like a duration in it is the time it takes to
deliver the message bytes and request-response latency. If you try to
use that you will find that users spend an *extremely small* amount of
time visiting URLs. The vast majority of time is spent elsewhere doing
things with the response objects.

Semi-reliable user tracking was possible back in the 1980-1990s - though
the coffee problem has always been an issue. But with the invention of
multiple-windows on a screen, and more recently tabbed browsing the
ability to guess offline activity for page A vs page B is much reduced.


I know there are lots of companies etc out there saying they can track
user activity for third-party sites. They are lying-by-omission, at most
they are tracking the activity of some marker which may (or may not)
actually be representing &quot;a user&quot; through some series of message
transactions. It always comes down to somebody making a guess about
whether any two requests are related.
