The HTTP auth label &quot;NTLM&quot; was used by some old client software to
deliver LanMan protocol credentials (DOS 1.0 thru Windows 98 to give you
an idea of scale) - which is essentially 8-bit encrypted username+password.

Naturally a lot of more modern systems are not permitting that type of
downgrade attack anymore. I susect your OS upgrade came with an upgrade
to either CentOS Samba version ntlm_auth helper which dropped supprot
for those 20+ year old insecure protocols.

IIRC the &quot;fix&quot; for this is to turn off MSIE &quot;Windows Integrated
Authentication&quot; on machines which are not part of a domain. That leaves
them with selecting Basic auth which works.

Alternatively upgrading the domain to Kerberos (Negotiate auth) instead
of NTLM has also long been recommended.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I assume the problem is due to ntlm auth doesn't fall back to basic but

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know how to force squid to fallback to basic auth if ntlm auth fail?

</I>
There is no way to force fallback. Squid is merely advertising the set
of HTTP auth schemes it accepts. The client software makes the choice
which to use.
