I think that it's not an issue if you are bumping.
Youtube these days forces https whenever they can so you will probably 
won't have this issue at all.

Youtube is not a basic case but take a look at their smaller content 
such as youtube images which consist of one key for them all using the 
video ID which is different from vimeo and many others.

Are you looking for some sites to analyze for practice?
