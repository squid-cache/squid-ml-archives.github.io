Doing so is the features intended purpose.

When correctly used TLS cannot be decrypted.

BUt, most use of HTTPS today is not using TLS correctly.

If it could be bumped at all then it could be dumped as easily as
inspected by an AV.

Like a sharp knife can be as easily used for cutting vegetables as
throats. Ones intent has nothing to do with the tools capability or lack.
