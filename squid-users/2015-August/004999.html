I completely agree with you, I shouldn't have mixed intent with
capability which is great and which I intend to put to good use.

So, if I understand well, if I just send traffic to squidclamav on icap
tcp port, then I don't store usernames and passwords or private emails
in cache?

This is important to me in order to explain the complete mechanism to
management and to create understandable policy for end users.
