Stale objects *do* stay in cache. I think that behaviour is pretty much
what happens with LRU in practice. To be removed it has to be *the*
least recently used object in cache when that watermark algorithm we are
fixing in the other thread runs.

Its just that if you are talking an object used literally once a month
and the smaller objects have a high churn rate resulting in a 1-week LRU
age. Then it would be stored for only that week before it met the
criteria for removal. If its touched at any time in that week its
LRU-age becomes 0 again and starts re-counting back towards a week while
the churn goes on with other objects.

The current policy/algorithm options are here:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_replacement_policy/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_replacement_policy/</A>&gt;

new ones are possible of course with the usual wait/sponsor/DIY options
and disclaimers about feature requests.


Note that this is all per-cache_dir. What I recommend is a cache_dir
with some TB of HDD behind it for approx. GB sized objects.

That way they are *not* competeing with many small objects at high churn
rate. The cache_dir LRU age could be weeks/months/years if all the big
objects are reasonably low popularity.

Also, you can size the cache_dir capacities to avoid wastage in the
smaller cache_dir from the 2^25 object limitations vs the size of
objects stored there.
