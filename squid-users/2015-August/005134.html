&gt;<i> Looking for one single thing that does everything DG or e2guardian do,
</I>&gt;<i> or wraps them completely is the wrong approach. They are almost
</I>&gt;<i> full-blown proxies like Squid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The *CAP design is to leave all the transfer proxying and caching duties
</I>&gt;<i> to software like Squid and only perform the actual content adaptation
</I>&gt;<i> policies in the service/module.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You need to look at what DG is doing for you now and how much of that is
</I>&gt;<i> available from squid.conf capabilities. Most of it usually is. Only the
</I>&gt;<i> remaining &quot;fiddling with payloads&quot; bit actually needs a third-party service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes I know that Squid is very powerful, but (DG or E2) seems - to me - more easier with complex rules
I'm working with multi users groups, regex in HTML, rules with exceptions (site allowed if some conditions), etc

I guess if I reproduce my configuration in squid.conf it will be more hard to maintain after ..
 
Also these soft are massively multi-threaded, in my usage squid + dg use less CPU than Squid alone I mean the load is shared by the cores. 
I also tried squid with SMP but there are some restrictions (delay pool, identification - if I remember right -)  


&gt;<i> GreasySpoon or qlproxy seems to be the high profile ones. c-icap and
</I>&gt;<i> Traffic Spicer seem to offer frameworks rather than pre-made filters
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Misc/icap.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Misc/icap.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The interfaces GreasySpoon or qlproxy describe say easily scriptable to
</I>&gt;<i> do filtering. Though filtering is a huge topic, so &quot;easily&quot; is up for
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation.
</I>
Thanks, I will take a look 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And fiddling around with your customers content is very site-specific
</I>&gt;<i> about what can or can't be done. Thus the frameworks and script engines
</I>&gt;<i> being most high profile.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes you are right, I wish that there is a change in E2, for me the ideal situation is SQUID (cache and identification) and a pool of E2 with ICAP
I guess that there is no hope for SquidGuard because it's very different, a redirector related with Squid
