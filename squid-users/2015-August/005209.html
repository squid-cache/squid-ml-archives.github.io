If your community of users wants a caching proxy server, why make it 
transparent?

I'm assuming that you're in charge of both a DHCP server giving the users 
their IP addresses, and local caching DNS server doing name resolution, so why 
not just implement PAC <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config</A> and let 
the clients discover the caching proxy and then use it?

Even if you can't do this, why not set up a proxy (not in transparent mode), 
tell the users how to connect to it, and let them use it because they want to?

Configuring a proxy such as squid in transparent mode never works quite as 
well as configuring it for explicit mode (where the clients know they're 
talking to a proxy), so this would give you a better end result as well as 
being easier to set up.


Hope that helps,


Antony.

PS: If you feel you really do want to set up a transparent proxy, but have 
failed to get Squid to do what you need, please at least let us know what you 
have tried so far so we can help you deal with the problem.  This means 
telling us:

 - the network configuration, being especially clear about where the Squid 
machine is in the network setup
 - the squid.conf you are trying to use (without comments or blank lines)
 - how you are testing it and finding that it doesn't work
 - what you are seeing (browser errors, log file messages, etc) to indicate 
that it doesn't work.
