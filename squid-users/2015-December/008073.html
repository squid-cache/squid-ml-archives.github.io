Fast automated detection. Absolute minimal response to identified
requests. Push the cost as far back up the traffic path towards the
attacker as possible. Those are the answers to DDoS.

Squid already does pretty well against many of the common (old'ish) DDoS
types. Though there are some countermeasures that could still be
improved, and some DDoS types that are not protected against at all.

There are many forms of DoS to begin with, and *how* the DoS is turned
into DDoS is one of the important considerations. There are many
possible forms that could take. So the big question to start with is
what type of DDoS are you trying to protect against?
