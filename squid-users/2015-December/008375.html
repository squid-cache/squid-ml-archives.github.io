Theoretically the client browser is fully aware of what credentials it
can use for what schemes (Kerberos, Basic, NTLM, Digest [in that orer of
security]). And also for remembering which credentials worked or failed
on previosu attempts with the offered schemes.

So there is no need to filter them at the proxy. *it* is perfectly able
to authenticate any credentials it gets given using any of the schemes
it is offering. You just happen to not like the outcome when validation
prevents login.

</I>
It has been a feature request for years to allow ACL control of auth
schemes offered. I even have a design plan laid out for implemeting it.
But nobody seems to want it enough to sponsor the addition (if you do
please contact me directly to discuss).

I am specifically waiting for sponsorship on this one because it needs
someone with an actual use-case and implementation to test that it works
properly with Negotiate and NTLM.

Otherwise please open a feature request bug to track the status and get
notification when somebody does get around to adding it.
