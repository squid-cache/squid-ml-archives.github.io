Several other things could have happened:
* HSTS headers from the server are received by the browser,
* Alternative-Protocol headers received by the browser,
* CRL and OSCP browser lookups without the proxy,
* or any combo of the above.

Alternative-Protocol is particularly bad since it can cause the browser
to move away from HTTP entirely and use some other protocol. Chrome has
a thing for moving traffic from HTTP to Google custom protocols. MSIE
should be pretty good though it might move to HTTP/2.

HSTS requires the browser to start directly with a secure protocol
rather than HTTP (ie through the proxy). When combined with
Alternative-Protocol the two could potentially force HTTP and the proxy
to cease being even considered as a traffic route (if browser thinks the
other protocol is more secure).

Since these happen inside the CONNECT tunnel use to go through an
explicit-proxy Squid does not have a chance to prevent the
Alternative-Protocol taking effect.

OSCP and CRL are annoying but friendly enough to proxy.  Just find out
what the needed URI are and ensure they are permitted through the proxy.
