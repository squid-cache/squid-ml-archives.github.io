But logging is not the only thing that SNI is used for.

Both the peek to get the SNI and the resulting IP-&gt;hostame changes from
finding SNI introduce different logic behaviour.

What redirect ?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it would appear that squid-3.5.10 in splice-only mode still
</I>&gt;<i> enables the &quot;Host header forgery&quot; check?
</I>
1) Host check is initiated for all requests received on intercepted traffic.

2) SSL-bump traffic fakes a CONNECT with raw-IP details that gets passed
through those (1) checks.

3) SNI presence changes the CONNECT from raw-IP to one with a Hostname.
That Hostname needs to match the TCP connection raw-IP.


&gt;<i> Surely if all you are doing is
</I>&gt;<i> splice-only, it shouldn't be doing that check at all? ie I could
</I>&gt;<i> understand triggering blocking actions if squid was part of the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction in bump-mode - but when it's &quot;only looking&quot;, it is exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the same as not doing splice at all - so why trigger the Host header check?
</I>
It is not only looking. It is updating internal state and logics based
on what it sees in the TLS.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It does look like TOR has something equivalent to a /etc/host file with
</I>&gt;<i> fake DNS names - so it's quite understandable that freaks squid out.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, if squid cannot resolve a SNI hostname, shouldn't that skip
</I>&gt;<i> the Host name check?
</I>
Well, Squid should not get to the point of testing Host name in the HTTP
messages. SNI is mandatory to contain a resolvable FQDN. Not doing so is
a TLS protocol violation and Squid should just abort down to either
terminate or blindly tunnel based on your on_unknown_protocol settings.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, this isn't that easy to test: it would appear that once I turned
</I>&gt;<i> off intercept and successfully used TOR, it must have cached a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> things because I then re-enabled intercept and it's no longer making any
</I>&gt;<i> tcp/443 connections - it goes straight out on other &quot;native&quot; TOR ports.
</I>&gt;<i> So it may be this can only be tested on a fresh install (or after some
</I>&gt;<i> cache timeout period)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

if you want to dig into this further I suggest getting a &quot;debug_options
ALL,9&quot; output and looking at what cache.log says about the state of the
request that is being checked and failing.
