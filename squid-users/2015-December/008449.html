How?  What squid.conf did you use?  What results did you get?  What didn't 
work?

<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A> should point you in the 
right direction.

Please try that, and if you run into problems, let us know:

 - what you have in squid.conf (without comments or blank lines)
 - which exact version of Squid you are using
 - which browser/s you are using
 - which URL/s you are trying to access and having problems with
 - what shows up in Squid's access log when you connect to those URLs

Good luck,


Antony.
