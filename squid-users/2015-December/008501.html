SG is no longer maintained software. As Marcus already mentioned 
ufdbguard can be used instead if you really need the helper at all.

The distro providers which still provide SG are patching their packages 
to cope with the newer Squid helper protocol. If you cannot get away 
from SG, then you need to also to rebuild SG from that newer repository 
to maintain the lock-step dependency between them.
  But that said; everything SG provides a current Squid can also do 
(maybe better) by itself.
