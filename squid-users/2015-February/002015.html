Means exactly what it says.

Expedia is hosted on Akamai. Akamai load balance their CDN by doing DNS
response tricks. I'm seen a few different types of failure resulting
from that.
 - in Expedias case the DNS TTL is 12 seconds and there are two layers
of CNAME to resolve before one gets to an IP. Those CNAMEs themselves
only have TTL of a few minutes.


The Akamai behaviour that could result in that no-IPs error is when only
CNAME results are returned. Squid relies on the resolver to do the
recursion. Sometimes all Squid gets is a bunch of nested CNAME with no
IP to connect to. This is particularly bad with IPv6 lookups when the
Akamai client is not v6-enabled (expedia is one such).


Your Squid version can also impact results. 3.1 originally did two
sequential lookups, for AAAA and A records. That was changed to parallel
in 3.3, but still the longer of the two must fit within the timeout.
