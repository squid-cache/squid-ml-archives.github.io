No, 90-95% memory utilisation means the OS is effectively using the
resources it has available.  This is normal on an active machine,
particularly Solaris.  What memory is not being used for processes directly is
being used as file cache to speed accesses.  As long as your process
demands do not exceed physical RAM then all will be fine, the file cache
size will shrink and grow depending on process demands.
