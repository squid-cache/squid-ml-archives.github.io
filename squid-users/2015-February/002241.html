0 shutting down. Always.

During nights and weekends.

&gt;<i> Hey Yuri,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are couple sides and side-effects to the issue you describe.
</I>&gt;<i> If it's OK with you I will for a sec look aside squid and the helpers 
</I>&gt;<i> code to another issue in Computer Science.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let say we are running some server\software which it's purpose is to 
</I>&gt;<i> calculate the distance from point X to Y for a user.(A real world 
</I>&gt;<i> existing software which was written for DOS)
</I>&gt;<i> Since this piece of software size is about 50kB the user never 
</I>&gt;<i> experienced any issues with this particular software.
</I>&gt;<i> The issues came in when the user needed to run some complex 
</I>&gt;<i> calculations on a big list of points from a map.
</I>&gt;<i> From what I have seen in the past a 133Mhz CPU should take the load, 
</I>&gt;<i> and indeed did not had any issues working with a big set of points 
</I>&gt;<i> what so ever was thrown at it.
</I>&gt;<i> The main complexity with this piece of software was when the 
</I>&gt;<i> calculations needed to be more complex and turned from X to Y to &quot;from 
</I>&gt;<i> X to Y considering A B C D E F G H I&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the CPU got hogged a bit and there for the calculation took a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> longer then expected by the user.
</I>&gt;<i> Just as a side note this DOS system didn't had any SWAP at all.
</I>&gt;<i> This software is still in use since about 198x until these days with 
</I>&gt;<i> no SWAP at all while the calculations are being made daily by lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> users around my country.
</I>&gt;<i> From Computer Science point of view this piece of software is one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the most efficient ever existed on earth and while it was written for 
</I>&gt;<i> DOS it is still efficient enough to support many other systems around 
</I>&gt;<i> the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't any developer want to write a code in this level?? I believe 
</I>&gt;<i> and know that any developer strives to write a software that will use 
</I>&gt;<i> the available system resources efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> But for any developer there is a point which he sees how his knowledge 
</I>&gt;<i> alone might not be enough to make a simple piece of software run as 
</I>&gt;<i> smooth and as efficient as this simple DOS software.
</I>&gt;<i> I have never asked the creator of this DOS program how much efforts it 
</I>&gt;<i> took from him and his companions to write such a great piece of ART 
</I>&gt;<i> which is one of a kind, it was not because he is dead or something 
</I>&gt;<i> similar but since I understand it's a complex task which I am not 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to mimic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And back to squidguard, I myself have tried to understand why it uses 
</I>&gt;<i> so much ram and other resources which should have not being occupied 
</I>&gt;<i> at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually I have written my own version which is a mimic for 
</I>&gt;<i> squidguard basic filtering logic.
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen this behavior you do see and I have couple of times tried 
</I>&gt;<i> to at least make something better then it is now.
</I>&gt;<i> The task was not simple but my idea after lots of time of thinking was 
</I>&gt;<i> to separate most of the logic outside of the url_rewrite interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not just try to solve the issue as &quot;60 processes Absolutely 
</I>&gt;<i> idle&quot;, this might not be the issue in hands at all!
</I>&gt;<i> This conclusion can divert you from the real issue in this situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are up to the task to share(publicly is not a must) a top 
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot of the machine at midnight while you see the issue I will 
</I>&gt;<i> gladly be more then happy to try and understand the issue in hands.
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty sure that the command &quot;top -n1 -b&quot; should work in any unix 
</I>&gt;<i> system I have seen until today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have access to this squid machine cache manager interface?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, of course - question. How to do that? I've don't seen this, if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, for this config stub:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> url_rewrite_program /usr/local/bin/squidGuard -c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/local/squidGuard/squidGuard.conf
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> url_rewrite_children 100 startup=0 idle=1 concurrency=0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After daily activity, at midnight, still remain near 60 processes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Absolutely idle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, why?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
