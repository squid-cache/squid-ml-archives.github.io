We are talking not about the differences between any *NIX-based or
*NIX-like OS. Android just an example. I guess an observerd behaviour
of redirector's processes is not expected.

Now I've observed mentioned behaviour of redirectors over one month. I
just want to know - is this desired behaviour or this is a bug.

If this is bug - need to report it as bug.

If this need, I'm ready to grant access to bare-metal installed
Solaris system with Squid and squidGuard to tests for developers.

If your one of them - you are welcome.

&gt;<i> Hey Yuri,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I looked eventually at Solaris 11 man pages at: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29030/ps-1.html#scrolltoc">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29030/ps-1.html#scrolltoc</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Just to be sure the next command would run: &quot;ps -e&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no subject to the discussion yet since the issue is yet to
</I>&gt;<i> be defined as an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mentioned Android autoclose but you must first be clear from a
</I>&gt;<i> doubt! Android is indeed Linux kernel based and provides some APIs
</I>&gt;<i> for gui and other components of the system but it is much different
</I>&gt;<i> by nature. If you would take a simple PC from 10 years ago indeed
</I>&gt;<i> an Android device beats it's specs and will have much more ram and
</I>&gt;<i> CPU speed\power. Android however with all it's API would not allow
</I>&gt;<i> just any process handle &quot;iptables&quot; rules out of the box in any
</I>&gt;<i> form. Is there a reason for that? maybe yes and maybe not but I
</I>&gt;<i> mostly don't care about it since it's not being used mostly for
</I>&gt;<i> servers grade operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would definitely not want to call you stupid but sometimes even
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot catch\understand\hold others way of thinking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's indeed not hard to execute pkill -9 &quot;XYZ&quot; but from my
</I>&gt;<i> experience any similar operation should not be considered as a
</I>&gt;<i> production action. In a case of bug that is being fixed\tested or a
</I>&gt;<i> software that is out of maintenance it might be the only solution
</I>&gt;<i> but yet is not recommended.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that any action you would do regarding this squidGuard
</I>&gt;<i> helpers will cost something like any other server simple
</I>&gt;<i> operation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Squid basically tries to take in account that to every operation
</I>&gt;<i> there is cost and the admin will prefer to run the server for more
</I>&gt;<i> then a period of 24\48 hours. I understand that there is memory
</I>&gt;<i> that is being used by squidGuard and I would not expect it to not
</I>&gt;<i> consume any memory at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next step are not common CS use practice: - The first step
</I>&gt;<i> before rushing to terminate squidGuard would be to check what is
</I>&gt;<i> the DB files size which squidGuard uses. - Then I would try to
</I>&gt;<i> estimate what RAM usage I would expect for this logic and for the
</I>&gt;<i> DB files. - At this point some would try to sacrifice some aspects
</I>&gt;<i> of performance compared to others due to what so ever reason. -
</I>&gt;<i> Others might try other directions.(I will take this &quot;other&quot; one.) 
</I>&gt;<i> -- Consider what is more important between couple things: * System
</I>&gt;<i> ram or CPU utilization * System stability * System disk access
</I>&gt;<i> reduction * System network utilization * System ching ching (ie $$
</I>&gt;<i> or other concurrency) costs -- Based on choosing one or more from
</I>&gt;<i> the options above and\or others that the human mind can take in
</I>&gt;<i> account, list them and make sure what the current issue in hands
</I>&gt;<i> hits and maybe by that costs or might cost money or sleep or fuel
</I>&gt;<i> or happiness or other important things that are considered to be a
</I>&gt;<i> loss and or a benefit. From this point on the solution in most of
</I>&gt;<i> the time is simpler then some might imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I think is the right place to stop the actual lookup for one 
</I>&gt;<i> solution or other and simply understand the technical issue you see
</I>&gt;<i> and understand it.
