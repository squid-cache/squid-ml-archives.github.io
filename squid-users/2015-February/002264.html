<PRE>Hey Yuri,

You missed the whole point.
I didn't wanted you to grep any output.
I wanted to see the whole server process list as a whole to understand 
the issue you see.
If you see the server only with grep you might missing something since I 
have yet to see your server do any swap what so ever until now.

An idle process is fine by nature.
Many systems has many idle processes at the background.
It's in SLEEP mode while waiting for squid to send it's data\request.
What have you seen wrong about it? I am happy to understand.
 From squid point of view idle is not about if the process is in SLEEP 
or IDLE mode and you will see the OS in SLEEP mode while from squid 
aspect it's IDLE.

I have tried to understand what version of squid are you running but 
until now didn't got it.

Some dozens? and what is the cachemgr url_rewrite helper statistics 
output at the time you see the issue?
