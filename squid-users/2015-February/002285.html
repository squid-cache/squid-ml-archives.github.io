Yeah and one of the many reasons its effectively a dead project now.
IIRC, Shalla were going to maintain SG for a while but with all the
useful functionality being duplicated in ufdbGuard (amongst others)
and/or Squid itself there is not much point in keeping the old helper
around.

It has got so many legacy installs depending on it and tutorials
encouraging people to use it even today. Its proving hard to oust the
dear old zombie. :-(


PS. Marcus, perhapse you should go on search around to find distro
maintainers who are publishing SG and convince them to replace the
defaults with ufdbguard. I have to do that periodically to clear up old
Squid versions being forced on users. It helps to find out what bugs
they are patching or struggling with silently as well.
 Making the upgrade/switch as seamless as possible is important too.
