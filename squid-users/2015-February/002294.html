Hm, the problem I see with that is that package maintainers are not always 
admins of the systems using those packages, therefore they're not the people 
who run into the problems caused by outdated packages.

Lots of system admins (the ones who don't appear on this list, for example) 
just assume &quot;it's the current software being provided by my distro, therefore 
it must be the one recommended by the developers&quot;, therefore they never find 
out that the developers of the software recommend doing something new, while 
the package maintainers have never moved on from old versions or old 
techniques.

I do think we need to inform package maintainers that what they're doing is no 
longer what the developers recommend, to try to close the gap between the 
people who start from &quot;here's what I get from my distro&quot; and &quot;but this is the 
right way to do things&quot; (which we see often enough on this and similar lists).

When the package maintainer is a developer, this situation generally sorts 
itself out pretty quickly, but this is not often (AFAIK) the case, so 
announcing the current recommendations to the people runnning the distros can 
make a big difference.


Regards,


Antony.
