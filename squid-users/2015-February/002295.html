<PRE>Also, gents.

ufdbGuard is cool, but:

- Where is good documentation? I found only one connon PDF. No 
performance recommendations, no administrator's guide - this good piece 
of software not so trivial as squidGuard, i.e., I don't know, how to 
support only used blocking categories databases without rebuilding them 
all, no concepts guide - the architecture of solution is not obvious. 
May be I need glasses, but Reference manual + man pages is not enough 
for average SA's. Not at all will read sources.

- AFAIK, it uses daemon-centric architecture. Well, but different OS 
uses different startup facilities. I want to have possibility to tune it 
up by myself or installation must correct do it on target OS. And please 
note, that not only Linux existing in the world. ;) SystemV init was 
deprecated in some systems years ago. ;) And will be good to document 
all of this in installation guide.

Did you agree?
