</I>Will do, thanks for the tip.

</I>&gt;<i> It should be but there are conditions to that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * another source of the URL is actually accessible (think IPv6-only
</I>&gt;<i> websites, routing outages, DNS lookup failures, Path-MTU failures,
</I>&gt;<i> traffic blackholes, etc)
</I>If I re-send a failing request with Cache-Control: no-cache, or if I 
remove the cache_peer directive, I don't get any errors at all so it 
doesn't seem like this is the problem here.
&gt;<i> * there is time remaining within the forward_timeout for the alterative
</I>&gt;<i> route to be contacted. If the timeout occurs the last error state
</I>&gt;<i> encountered will be reported, if there is no earlier error the timeout
</I>&gt;<i> itself is mentioned.
</I>I believe the default timeout is 4 minutes? I set it explicitely to 10 
minutes, and forward-max-tries to 25 for good measure, and requests are 
still failing within hundreds of milliseconds so I don't think this is 
related.
&gt;<i> * the 504 is not being cached. That error response is one which is
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to be cached by proxies if it gets delivered with cacheability
</I>&gt;<i> headers. NP: It could be cached and delivered by either proxy, so even
</I>&gt;<i> coming from the other one *it* may still have been cached and what
</I>&gt;<i> caused the &quot;HIT&quot; to be identified.
</I>I don't think the error is being served from cache. If I look at the 
access logs for both machines I see:

1424437827.131	6 127.0.0.1 	TCP_MISS/504		4913	GET <A HREF="http://example.net/">http://example.net/</A> - SIBLING_HIT/10.0.1.2	text/html

&#8230; on A and

1424437827.882	0 10.0.1.1	TCP_MISS/504		4801	GET <A HREF="http://example.net/">http://example.net/</A> - HIER_NONE/- 		text/html

&#8230; on B, 10.0.1.1 being A and 10.0.1.2 being B.
&gt;&gt;<i> What confuses me even more is that this didn't happen a month ago, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same setup.
</I>&gt;<i> ... what version of Squid?
</I>&gt;<i> ... and is it the same setup AND version(s) of Squid from a month ago?
</I>I'm running Squid 3.5.2 on both servers. I was running 3.5.1 on both a 
week ago and observing the same problem.

I can't say for sure which version I was running before this started 
happening, but I believe it was 3.4.8 on one machine and 3.4.10 on the 
other.
