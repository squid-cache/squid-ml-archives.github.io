Hey HackXBack,

I am not to familiar with all of the mobile apps but if the client needs 
filtering he needs it..
I do not think that youtube should be used in a mobile app that is not 
using any of the device certificates DB.
I have seen that most apps are using Android or any other device 
certificate device since these devices are a part of a service that 
serves enterprises and corporations which needs this restriction.
If someone is a part of an enterprise or a corporation he should not use 
a non-compatible to his needs device.

I will need to test how different devices react to a ssl-bump situation 
but it's not one of my goals for now.
I am happy with what I have that works fine for me and many others.
Maybe in the future I will have more needs that will might force to some 
new things.

The main thing I am working on now is the 3.5.2 testing for general use 
which not includes ssl-bump as a tested feature but the RPM includes it 
in order to make it available to the CentOS users who wish to make some 
progress and understand that squid has a class of it's own.
