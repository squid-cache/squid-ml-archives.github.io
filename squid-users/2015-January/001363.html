The external acl method mentioned earlier probably out-does using some
NIDS feedback loop. In my testing it causes squid to block that new
connection until it returns, and that means your external acl script can
simply attempt a SSL transaction against the end-server and in realtime
figure out that it's SSL or not. And then cache it, blah, blah blah.

The advantage is that it will do a lookup on new HTTPS sessions and
potentially have the answer immediately (ie it can bump on first
attempt), whereas a NIDS would only find out the answer after squid has
defaulted to passthrough/splice mode, so it would only work properly on
future connections to that site.

&gt;<i> I like the active external acl solution since it meets a need, but

</I>
If you think the external acl method is too expensive to run, how do you
expect to feed this NIDS data back into squid? I think you'd find you'd
need an external acl check to do that bit anyway :-)
