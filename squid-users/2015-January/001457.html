<PRE>Published at: <A HREF="http://www1.ngtech.co.il/wpe/?p=8">http://www1.ngtech.co.il/wpe/?p=8</A>

I am happy to release the new RPMs of squid 3.4.10 and 3.5.0.4 beta for 
Centos 6.6 64bit and 32bit .

The new release includes couple bug fixes and improvements.
The links to the RPMs are at the bottom of the article.

&#8220;What if a human would act as a proxy server?&#8221;


One of the hardest jobs on the planet earth would be a &#8220;proxy&#8221; that 
needs to connect between a requester and the right response. The proxy 
would need first to identify the request and understand it properly and 
then needs to decide what to lookup in the database for a corresponding 
response.
It's a very messy job since the source IP and all the request 
characteristics should be answered. In many cases the request will not 
give enough information about the wanted response and the user will need 
to request another time for the requested data. I would assume that it 
would require some buildings to be populated with lots of &#8220;proxies&#8221; to 
fulfill all humans web requests. But the reality is not that far from 
this fantasy.
If you would look at the world you would see that lots of humans just 
act as a simple proxy between someone to somebody else or something 
else. A nice example would be when you go to a wood store to buy some 
woods for a fire. If this would be your first time you would not know 
the prices and wood kinds while the wood-shop guy would know more then 
you. He then acts as a proxy between your mind and his to understand the 
different kinds of wood that can fulfill your needs while giving you the 
prices.
And while writing I am thinking about it again, and one of the hardest 
jobs there are in the market is the &#8220;Match Maker&#8221;. Just to illustrate 
that a human would have been a proxy and a &#8220;Match Maker&#8221;. Actually a 
&#8220;Match Maker&#8221; job would be to take two different minds and put them 
together while understanding them both enough to make them both happy 
about the meetings.
So how would a &#8220;Match Maker&#8221; would act if he was a proxy? He would need 
to fetch or get from the clients information about their wishes and 
analyze their requests to find a matching pair. From the requester side 
he needs something, a companion.
But from the &#8220;Match Maker&#8221; point of view there is a need to actually 
find a match which would stick for a very long time and that would not 
cause harm while building love and harmony. I am not a &#8220;Match Maker&#8221; but 
I do believe that a simple piece of software can help the human which 
actually needs help from others to do other tasks which a proxy cannot 
do good enough.

* Any notes and comments are wanted and welcome!
