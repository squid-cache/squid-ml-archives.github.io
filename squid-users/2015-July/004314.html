<PRE>&#8206;Good morning Amos, 
I would unsuscribe from the mailing list. I have unsuscribed from the forum yet, but i receive mail again.
I found the forum very useful, but at the moment i have a different mission &#160;in my firm.
With reguards

They have *an* object cached for the URL. But not the one the client is
requesting from that same URL. Or its got some revalidation requirements
attached. Thats what Chudy found. As a result the sibling is unable to
supply its cached object as the answer.

</I>&gt;<i> I could understand it could be a bug but the squid client should see the 504

</I>
For example;
the client wants object no more than 60 seconds old with unique label
&quot;ETag:blahblah&quot;. But the sibling has a 90 second old object labeled
&quot;ETag:oops&quot;.

It would have to contact the origin to get a new copy, which is
forbidden by the sibling relationship Cache-Control:only-if-cached criteria.


It's a common problem when using ICP or cache digests which consider
only the URL to identify objects. HTCP was created to resolve that
problem by considering the whole HTTP header when testing the peer for
objects. Though I'm not sure myself if it would resolve the
only-if-cached issue.

</I>
Strange if that is working.

The reforwarding happens on 502 and 504 status without any special
configuration. That directive just adds 403, 500, 501 and 503 to the
list of status that can be retried.


&gt;<i> Then, having a dedicated cable between squid servers is not a realistic
</I>&gt;<i> solution, my ISP will not see that as a serious solution 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last point, &quot;no-tproxy rule on parent type cache_peer&quot;, it does not work, we

</I>&gt;<i> We applied that option 1 month ago and the internet sees the squid ip, not
</I>&gt;<i> the original ip address, so maybe another bug here... 
</I>
Nod. Without the dedicated link between proxies and TPROXY the parent
(or sibling) wont be aware of what IP the original client was using.
