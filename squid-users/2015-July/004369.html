<PRE>I'm setting up a squid proxy with LDAP user/group authentication, and so 
far have been able to sort out the problems I've run into with a little 
help from google and caches of the various squid mailing lists. 

Currently, it's in a mostly working state for nearly everything (i.e. 
user authentication, allowed/blocked based on what group a user belongs 
to, client pc auto-updates, etc.).  However, I can't figure out how to 
force a user to re-authenticate after a set interval of time (say 30 
mintues).


Essentially, the idea is that the &quot;less-privileged&quot; users (i.e. the 
students) can get to the sites that they need for their day-to-day school 
work, but that their permissions should be able to be elevated for a set 
amount of time in the event the teacher deems it OK.  

Right or wrong, the administration doesn't want to go with one of the 
&quot;big boys&quot; in web filters, so I need to kick the users and force a re-
auth, as this is for a school environment. It's small (only 10-15 
students at one time), but the students have already figured their way 
around the previous filter that was installed before my time.


I know closing the browser clears out all the authentication tokens ... 
but hoping there's a way I can do this from the backend so there's no 
need to play those &quot;okay, now close all your browsers&quot; type games if a 
student gets the elevated permissions.


Leads have pointed me to 

 - auth_param basic credentials_ttl &lt;N&gt; minutes

 - authenticate_ttl &lt;N&gt; minutes

 - authenticate_cache_garbage_interval &lt;N&gt; minutes

Though I don't seem to be able to grasp the concept of getting them to do 
what I want (if it's possible)


Thanks!
