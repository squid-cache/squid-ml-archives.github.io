&quot;Its not working&quot; is back to very unhelpful info again. Specific details
are critical. As is confirming the very latest code still has the problem.


I mean details like;
* &quot;client is sending bytes XYZ instead of a TLS ClientHello packet&quot;, or
* &quot;client is sending clientHello with settings U,V which causes Squid to
do W&quot;, or
* &quot;server is responding to client E,F,G,M settings with TLS alert Q,
Squid then does R&quot;.

TLS is hugely complicated set of details and a whole protocol by itself.
Any one of those could be causing what appears to you as a failure even
with Squid operating perfectly fine. Or Squid may be breaking something
deeply subtle while othewise appearing to run fine.


If I assume this is in regards to one of the other bugs you have brought
up (like the halfClosedReader one). How is Squid to identify in advance
that a certain request (but not the one before it, or after) is going to
hit a bug that we cannot even track down a cause for yet?
 If the problem cause is known, we (mostly Christos) probably already
fixed it. I know its frustrating, but sometimes reality really sucks.

Intercepting TLS in the first place is a nasty can of worms. The
resulting problems are plentiful and new ones continually being added
(it is an actual literal &quot;arms race&quot; situation). The best help we can do
to support Christos whose working on fixing it all is to keep up with
his development progress and trying to avoid noise about already fixed
things. (Sorry dont mean to lecture the choir).
