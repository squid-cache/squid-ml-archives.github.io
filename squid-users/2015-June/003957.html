<PRE>I have a number of machines running BOINC which are having issues uploading with one particular project (climateprediction.net) however if I redirect the client to a Squid 2.7 server they work fine. It doesn't do it every time, some files work just fine. They are usually 15Mb or 47Mb uploads.

Below is the http debug messages from a BOINC client indicating it can't understand the encoding after its made initial contact. This was taken when talking to Squid 3.5.5 (Win Server 2008).

Cheers,
MarkJ
