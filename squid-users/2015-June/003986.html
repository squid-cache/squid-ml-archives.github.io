Not that I know of, but there is both more and less being done.

The &quot;more&quot;:

* IPv6 support adds an AAAA lookup.

* CVE-2009-0801 protection for intercepted traffic requires A+AAAA
lookup in situations which may previously not done any at all.

* hosts without FQDN may now have a .local variant looked up.

The &quot;less&quot;:

* re-sends of HTTP messages no longer perform full lookups on each
outbound connection attempt. Just one set per message now.

* .local domains no longer have any global DNS lookups. multicast-DNS is
used instead.
