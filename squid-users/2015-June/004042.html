That would be because the number of transactions is meaningless.

I can (and have) fully saturated a 100Mbps link using just 2 downloads.
Then a few minutes later pushed through 300K downloads without getting
more than a minor bump in its capacity.

Size and Speed of each transaction is what matters for saturation. thats
where delay pools comes in. It throttles the per-second size of bandwith
each client consumes. Slowing down only the heavy users.


Delay pools even works when the users try to abuse things with a
download accelerator program. Under your counting design these users
consume N slots and leave others unable to connect. With pools all their
attempts count against one pool, other clients get a fair(er) share.


&gt;<i> Delay_pools seems to be based upon throttling the speed rather than

Windows has a limit of 2K FDs which does that in a way. 2K means a
maximum capacity of only between 400-900 client connections in total.
