</I>Is that supposed to be in 3.5.5? I just noticed a problem with bumping
that came down to the
web server requiring client cert validation and squid-3.5.5 failed to
splice - so it failed going through bump
(as you'd expect).

I guess I'm asking if this new &quot;SSL determination&quot; includes detecting
client certs, because that would be a
good one to detect if possible?

Now that I think of it, that might be a mugs game. The site I'm
referring to had a &quot;SSLVerifyClient optional&quot;
on a subdirectory - so it's probably quite unfair to expect a TLS
Intercept to &quot;magically&quot; know what encrypted
urls it can fiddle with and what ones it can't ;-) Hmmm, OTOH maybe  if
squid decides a server is asking
for even optional client certs, that it declares the entire SNI to be
splice instead of bump - frankly I'd live with
that (ie it might start out bumping, but then flick to splice on the
first bit of evidence that some part needed
client certs - even optional)
