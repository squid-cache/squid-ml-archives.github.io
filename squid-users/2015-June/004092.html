It would seem so. AFAIK we are only detecting resumed sessions and
incompatible cipher sets at present. You may want to contact Christos
about the client certs.

FYI: the &quot;ssl_bump peek all&quot; config I have been advising, may not always
be the best. It seems there is some use for the &quot;stare&quot; option during
stage2 bumping instead of peek. But Im not sure yet myself on when its
best to do that over peek. You might awant to try it.
