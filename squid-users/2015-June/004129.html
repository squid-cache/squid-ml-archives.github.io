<PRE>Hi there

I'm starting to use ICAP as an AV content filter, having moved away from
using the  havp antivirus proxy as a parent proxy

Part of the problem with havp was that it stopped being developed years
ago and HTTP trickery had moved on in ways that basically it
couldn't support - but squid - being the wonderful piece of loved
software it is - was keeping up with the times :-)

Anyway, now that I'm trialing ICAP, I'm concerned about the same issue.
When a web page is requested by a client, what component does what? Does
squid do the download, pass the content to ICAP, or does it (like with
parent proxies), just tell the ICAP software to do the download itself?
You can see where I'm going, the latter would mean &quot;odd&quot; HTTP
applications which might work fine through squid might fail if the ICAP
software does things differently

(btw: &quot;odd&quot; can mean many things: even how dns lookups occur, ipv6
support,etc)

Thanks
