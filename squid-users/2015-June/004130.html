The former - squid does the download and passes the content to ICAP.

ICAP is simply a means for modifying, or providing information about, HTTP 
requests and responses which are fed to the ICAP server.  The ICAP server 
itself doesn't perform any HTTP requests.

See <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507</A> for more details (the diagrams in 3.1 
and 3.2 show how the dataflow works).

As that RFC says, &quot;ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for executing a 
'remote procedure call' on HTTP messages.  It allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP 
messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing&quot;.

Squid is the ICAP client in your setup.
