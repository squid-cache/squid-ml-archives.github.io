</I>
The order for these only matter for lines of the same directive name.
The http_access set get tested on the initial CONNECT request, then the
ssl_bump on each of the bumping steps, then if bumping decrypts the
http_access is run on the decrypted request(s).

</I>&gt;<i> I should note that we've been able to get filtering to work correctly when

</I>&gt;<i> so using the &quot;bump&quot; or man-in-the-middle style https filtering isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> viable option for us.
</I>
Then don't bother with any of this. You wont get transparent HTTPS
interception working without that MITM certificate install you already
ruled out.

Just use &quot;ssl_bump none all&quot; and Squid will relay the intercepted TCP
connections to the server they were destined for. Or better yet get rid
of the Squid step and let the traffic out on port 443 without slowing it
down for useless proxying.
