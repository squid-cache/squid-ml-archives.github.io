<PRE>Hello list,

I was wondering if someone has ever tried to use a SAN\NAS as the cache 
backend?
Since rock cache type\dir changed the file handling way from &quot;lots of 
files db&quot; into a single(and one more) cache db There is surly a way to 
benefit from nas and SAN.

If someone have used san(ISCSI) or nas(NFS) for any of the cahed dirs 
type I would like to run some tests and you can help me not repeat old 
tests resolts.

Thanks,
Eliezer
