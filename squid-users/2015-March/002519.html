Yes.

That depends on how much you trust the proxy.

If you trust it fully, then you only have to encrypt the client-&gt;proxy
connection. The client sends traffic inside that encrypted connection
as if it were normal HTTP to a proxy.

To cause the outbound connection to be encrypted the client sends URL
<A HREF="https://">https://</A> scheme. The proxy will separately encrypt the outbound
connection. When the proxy is built with SSL/TLS support this works
regardless of whether the client is connecting via HTTP or TLS to the
proxy.


If you *DONT* trust the proxy at all then use CONNECT tunnel with
second layer of TLS. You also have to use DANE/TLSA to validate the
server certificate using inside the CONNECT tunnel at the client end
since regular trusted-CA validation does not protect agaist proxies
bumping the CONNECT anyway.


&gt;&gt;<i> Once for the connection with the forward proxy and once for the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection with the reverse proxy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Re-encryption will performs only in case SSL-bumped connections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
*NO*.

A forward proxy receiving an <A HREF="https://">https://</A> scheme URL will always ensure
outbound DIRECT connections are encrypted between the proxy and origin
server.

A cache_peer connection can be un-encrypted, but they must be
explicitly configured by the admin. The peer will receive the <A HREF="https://">https://</A>
URL and try to encrypt its outbound under the same conditions.
