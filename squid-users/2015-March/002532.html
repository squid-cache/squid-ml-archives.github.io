No. You have one encryption layer, the TLS between the client and proxy.

The <A HREF="https://">https://</A> scheme tells the proxy what to do with the requests,
including that the need to be kept secure on the outbound connection.


&gt;<i> Also, if I configure my client to send traffic to Squid at port 3129,
</I>&gt;<i> then doesn't this mean I'm using Squid explicitly and not transparently?
</I>
That depends on what the other word in the phrase &quot;transparent ...&quot; is.

* Squid always performs &quot;transparent HTTP&quot; as much as it can with the
configuration you give it.

* Its up to you if the network performs &quot;transparent autoconfiguration&quot;
to deliver the proxy IP:port details to the client.


If by &quot;transparently&quot; you mean &quot;transparent interception&quot; then yes, its
not that. The Right Way to use a proxy is explicitly.
