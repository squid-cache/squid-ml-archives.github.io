</I>&gt;<i> There are two patches that need applying. One already in the 3.5 series
</I>&gt;<i> snapshots to fix SNI on some traffic cases, one still in QA review for
</I>&gt;<i> adding an ACL &quot;server_name&quot; that can match SNI without the helper.
</I>
That's very useful for the SNI matching indeed. Thanks!

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I am, but since I'm only splicing the connection, the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itself should be able to get the original certificate sent by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server, and handle it appropriately. Or am I mistaken there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is correct. But also they get it through the filter of your OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> version parsing and re-packing capabilities for the underlying TLS/SSL
</I>&gt;<i> protocol syntax.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those errors hint at things like the SSLv2/SSLv3 syntax being offered
</I>&gt;<i> and rejected, ALPN being mangled, or some advanced timing-based feature
</I>&gt;<i> being screwed up by the peek operation.
</I>
It seems so.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm using squid 3.5.2 built with openssl 0.9.8zc on Slackware 13.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Traffic is redirected from port 443 top 3130 with iptables.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... and with an older version of OpenSSL missing many of the last few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; years worth of TLS crypto features. IIRC the library releases are now up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to 1.1.* or something. Its best to keep that kind of thing operating the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; latest versions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know it missing the latest features, but security patches are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backported. And I know it is old, but it's what I have to work with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now.Do you think it might be the cause of the problem I'm having with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peek/splice, or was it a general recommendation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its a potential source of problems. Chrome is very much on the front
</I>&gt;<i> line of the arms race attempting to stop things like SSL-Bump working.
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox implement their own crypto library which tracks the latest TLS
</I>&gt;<i> features at a similar speed of development.
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL will be perpetually behind both of them, but at least the latest
</I>&gt;<i> one(s) have better chances not to be advertising features they reject in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;considered harmful&quot; grounds.
</I>
I'll have a go then at trying with a newer openssl and the patches from the  
thread you mentioned.

Thanks a lot so far,

Roel
