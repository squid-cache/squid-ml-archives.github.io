<PRE>Hey,

This is a very old post but I was unable to understand the solution to 
the issue.
I have looked again on the logs and since they show a 500 internal 
server error response I understood that the issue is not on the 
server(site) side only and might be on the client(eg other side of the 
internet and can be either a proxy or a web-browser).

Sometimes websites do not like to handle &quot;special&quot; request which was not 
meant to be there in the first place.

As an example:
I have seen couple times in the past(before 2013) that a public service 
was honoring *any* &quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot; headers which resulted in all sort 
of weird results while displaying the page.
One example was that instead of a link to the external web page address 
I got lots of internal urls which was not suppose to be there at all.
On this specific incident I had the chance to see how the &quot;internal&quot; 
network infrastructure is designed and implemented and which I know 
nobody planned to show me.

All The Bests,
Eliezer Croitoru
