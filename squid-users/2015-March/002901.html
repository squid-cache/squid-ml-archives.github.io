</I>&gt;<i> &lt;SC&gt; ICAP Service inspects the data that passes through it, and does selective filtering based on user policies.

Good to know. Though I meant more along the lines of what data its been sent and what Squid got back from it etc, in each step of the above theoretical sequence of operations. If they all worked properly there would be no hang problem.


&gt;<i> The Origin server is S3 or Box. We did tests without Squid in between, and the success ratio is high. We are trying to isolate this on a component basis, but the tcp dump shows that the squid did not respond at the TCP level. We were wondering if this is because Squid is busy. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Proxy does not acknowledge. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What type of &quot;acknowledge&quot; are you expecting here? HTTP or TCP level?
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;SC&gt; TCP level. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Aha. That only happens if the receive buffer in Squid is full, or Squid believes the request is fully received and is now waiting for the response data for it to deliver.

&lt;SC&gt; Is there a debug message that will be logged when Squid receive buffer is full?
&lt;SC&gt; What config parameter that we can use to increase Squid receive buffer?
