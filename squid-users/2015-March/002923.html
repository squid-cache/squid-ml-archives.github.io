&gt;<i> while load balancing is not a requirement in a proxy environment, it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i recently looked to see if a specific feature was in HAProxy.  i was
</I>&gt;<i> looking to see if HAProxy could reply to a new connection with a RST
</I>&gt;<i> packet if no pool member was available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the idea behind this is, if all of the proxies are not passing the
</I>&gt;<i> service check and are marked down by the load balancer, the reply of a
</I>&gt;<i> RST in the TCP handshake (i.e. SYN -&gt; RST, not SYN -&gt; SYN/ACK -&gt; ACK)
</I>&gt;<i> tells the browser to failover to the next proxy assigned by the PAC
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where i work, we have this configuration working.  the load balancers
</I>&gt;<i> are configured with the option to send a reset when no proxy is
</I>&gt;<i> available in the pool.  the PAC file assigns all 4 of the proxy VIPs in
</I>&gt;<i> a specific order based on which proxy VIP is assigned as the primary.
</I>&gt;<i> In every case, if the primary VIP does not have an available pool
</I>&gt;<i> member, the browser fails over to the next in the list.  failover would
</I>&gt;<i> happen again, if the secondary VIP replies with a RST during the
</I>&gt;<i> connection establishing.  the process repeats until a TCP connection
</I>&gt;<i> establishes or all proxies assigned have been exhausted.  the browser
</I>&gt;<i> will use the proxy VIP that it successfully connects to, for the
</I>&gt;<i> duration of the session.  once the browser is closed and reopened, the
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation of the PAC file occurs again, and the process starts anew.
</I>&gt;<i> plug-ins such as Proxy Selector are the exception to this, and can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to reevaluate a PAC file by selecting it for use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we have used this configuration several times, when we found an ISP link
</I>&gt;<i> was flapping or some other issue more global in nature than just the
</I>&gt;<i> proxies was affecting our egress and internet access.  i can attest to
</I>&gt;<i> the solution as working and elegantly handling site wide failures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> being that the solutions where i work are proprietary commercial
</I>&gt;<i> products, i wanted to find an open source product that does this.  i
</I>&gt;<i> have been a long time user of HAProxy, and have recommended it for
</I>&gt;<i> others here, but sadly they cannot perform this function.  per their
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list, they use the network stack of the OS for connection
</I>&gt;<i> establishment and cannot cause a RST to be sent to the client during a
</I>&gt;<i> TCP handshake if no pool member is available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> they suggested an external helper that manipulates IPTables rules based
</I>&gt;<i> on a pool member being available.  they do not feel that a feature like
</I>&gt;<i> this belongs in a layer 4/7 reverse proxy application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> my search for a load balancer solution went through ipvsadm, balance and
</I>&gt;<i> haproxy before i selected haproxy.  haproxy was more feature rich than
</I>&gt;<i> balance, and easier to implement than ipvsadm.  do any other list
</I>&gt;<i> members have a need for such a feature from their load balancers?  do
</I>&gt;<i> any other list members have site failover solutions that have been
</I>&gt;<i> tested or used and would consider sharing their design and/or pain
</I>&gt;<i> points?  i am not looking for secret sauce or confidential info, but
</I>&gt;<i> more high level architecture decisions and such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
trying to send this again, as it was rejected previously.
