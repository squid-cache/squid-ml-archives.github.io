<PRE>Was not sure if bugzilla was used for mailing list issues.  If you would
like me to open one, I will but it looks like the list is working again.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while load balancing is not a requirement in a proxy environment, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does afford a great deal of functionality, scaling and fault tolerance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in one.  several if not many on this list probably employ them for their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proxies and likely other technologies, but they are not all created
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i recently looked to see if a specific feature was in HAProxy.  i was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking to see if HAProxy could reply to a new connection with a RST
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet if no pool member was available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the idea behind this is, if all of the proxies are not passing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; service check and are marked down by the load balancer, the reply of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RST in the TCP handshake (i.e. SYN -&gt; RST, not SYN -&gt; SYN/ACK -&gt; ACK)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tells the browser to failover to the next proxy assigned by the PAC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where i work, we have this configuration working.  the load balancers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are configured with the option to send a reset when no proxy is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available in the pool.  the PAC file assigns all 4 of the proxy VIPs in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a specific order based on which proxy VIP is assigned as the primary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In every case, if the primary VIP does not have an available pool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; member, the browser fails over to the next in the list.  failover would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen again, if the secondary VIP replies with a RST during the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection establishing.  the process repeats until a TCP connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; establishes or all proxies assigned have been exhausted.  the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will use the proxy VIP that it successfully connects to, for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; duration of the session.  once the browser is closed and reopened, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluation of the PAC file occurs again, and the process starts anew.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plug-ins such as Proxy Selector are the exception to this, and can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used to reevaluate a PAC file by selecting it for use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we have used this configuration several times, when we found an ISP link
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was flapping or some other issue more global in nature than just the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proxies was affecting our egress and internet access.  i can attest to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the solution as working and elegantly handling site wide failures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being that the solutions where i work are proprietary commercial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; products, i wanted to find an open source product that does this.  i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been a long time user of HAProxy, and have recommended it for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others here, but sadly they cannot perform this function.  per their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mailing list, they use the network stack of the OS for connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; establishment and cannot cause a RST to be sent to the client during a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TCP handshake if no pool member is available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they suggested an external helper that manipulates IPTables rules based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on a pool member being available.  they do not feel that a feature like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this belongs in a layer 4/7 reverse proxy application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my search for a load balancer solution went through ipvsadm, balance and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; haproxy before i selected haproxy.  haproxy was more feature rich than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; balance, and easier to implement than ipvsadm.  do any other list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; members have a need for such a feature from their load balancers?  do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any other list members have site failover solutions that have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tested or used and would consider sharing their design and/or pain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; points?  i am not looking for secret sauce or confidential info, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more high level architecture decisions and such.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> trying to send this again, as it was rejected previously.
