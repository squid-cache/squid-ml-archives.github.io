     Yes snakeeyes, that's surely possible. Maybe not easy, but only a 
few things are not possible.

     However, as said in previous emails, this is the time that you 
should stop trying to ask for 'ready-to-use-rules' and start 
understanding that, as already said previously, blocking the way you 
want is not trivial, as internet browsing can look trivial to the user 
but it's definitely not on a technical view.

     Images can come in https connections and, thus, squid cannot see 
them. If you use SSL-Bump, filtering based on the content of SSL 
connections becames possible. That's not a trivial configuration, but 
that's surely possible.
