I am pretty sure that squid doesn't have the function\option but maybe there are others that do posses or able to fulfill this feature.

As much as I want new features and improvements in squid it is still possible for others to be able to write these bits of code.

Not been done.. ie in squid... squid is not the only software on the planet that does all sorts of ACLs.
Even if this page:
<A HREF="http://ngtech.co.il/squid/who_is_running_it/">http://ngtech.co.il/squid/who_is_running_it/</A>

Is the reality it doesn't mean that everybody should use squid and not seek or look at other options.
Even all these that are mentioned in the page above have their own developments which are not related to squid or Linux or BSD or any other OS.

Even if someone doesn't like it this is still the reality and even Linux with all his helpers are humans like any other human on the planet and it is possible in every moment that they can make a mistake and we are here to help them and all the other humans that are on the plant in this case that a mistake is happening.
