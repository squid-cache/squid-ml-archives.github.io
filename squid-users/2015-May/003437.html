The Store-ID interface requires concurreny support in the helpers it uses.

For your jesred it would mean receiving the channel-ID value at the
start of each request line from Squid and echoing it back as a prefix on
the answer lines.

</I>
There is, but you need to know the helper req/sec capacity to alculate it.

The easy way with current Squid is to set a high children number, with a
lower start=N and small idle=N parameters. Squid starts what helpers are
needed dynamically.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
If a helper dont have concurrency but Squid is expecting it to, the
first request may &quot;work&quot; but a second one will definitely hang.
