The tunnel.cc code producing that read/write error is one of the bits
still broken in regards to errno usage. So I dont entirely trust that
&quot;endpoint not connected&quot; detail, it seems right but could be something
subtly different.

Ayways, to get the output at all the TCP SYN/ACK handshake has to have
already setup the IPv6 connection with no errors. Then a (first? TLS?)
read/write operation attempted on the IPv6 socket fails and does that
log message.

There is supposed to be callback event protections preventing closed
sockets being used for read/write (adding to suspicion about the log
message), which is where I'm currently trying to figure out what state
things could be in.
