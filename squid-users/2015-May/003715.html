I don't know where you got that from, but that's not true. I think you
are confusing the issue that when squid is used as a transparent HTTPS
proxy, it lacks the &quot;easy&quot; hostname details that a formal (ie
non-transparent) proxy has. ie when a browser asks for a secure website
via a formal proxy, it sends

CONNECT github.com:443 HTTP/1.1

So squid knows *in advance* the server is called &quot;github.com&quot;. So it
connects to github.com, downloads the public key and then uses crtd to
create a clone of it - identical except that it's signed by your
self-created Squid CA instead of Verisign/whatever

Compare that with transparent proxy mode, where all that squid knows is
that a browser has had it's outbound tcp port 443 traffic to
192.30.252.128 redirected onto it, so it doesn't know that is
github.com. If you are using squid-3.4 or less, that's all there is to
it - there's no way to figure out the cert name in a guaranteed fashion
(there are hacks, but my own experience is that they can only work up to
95% of the time - and break for some of the largest sites). With
squid-3.5 there is &quot;peek&quot; - which means squid can let the initial few
packets through (ie act like &quot;splice&quot;) - which is enough to see the
client send the SNI request to the https server and get the reply. So
&quot;peek&quot; allows squid to learn about the true server name of the https
server. At that point *I think* squid creates a forged cert, then
creates a new connection to the server, then links together the existing
client tcp channel with the new proxy-&gt;server tcp channel and carries on
intercepting (I think that's the outcome - there would have to be some
extra smoke-n-mirrors in there to make that happen)

In pseudo-code, it looks like this

if http_port and &quot;CONNECT (.*) HTTP&quot; then sni_name=$1
else if https_port and &quot;peek&quot; then sni_name=find_sni($ipaddress)
else if https_port then sni_name=$ipaddress


When all is said and done, transparent HTTPS intercept is the very last
thing you should be working on. You need to gets squid working 100% as a
formal proxy - and only then start looking at making that work in
transparent mode. And you *definitely* want ssl_crtd.
