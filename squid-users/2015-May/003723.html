</I>&gt;<i> squid-3.5 there is &quot;peek&quot; - which means squid can let the initial few
</I>&gt;<i> packets through (ie act like &quot;splice&quot;)
</I>
I dont think that is right.

AFAIK, peek at step-1 lets the first few client packets buffer up inside
Squid instead of leaving them in the TCP buffers. That way it can
literally *peek* at the buffer contents to find the SNI without having
consumed them.


&gt;<i> - which is enough to see the
</I>&gt;<i> client send the SNI request to the https server and get the reply.
</I>
That would be is step-2.

Squid can selectively drain the buffered clientHello details toward the
server (peek @ step-2). Or Squid can send its own ClientHello faked
details (stare @ step 1 or 2) and repeat the peek process for the
serverHello packets.


&gt;<i> So
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;peek&quot; allows squid to learn about the true server name of the https
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>
This word &quot;true&quot; keeps getting thrown about in regards to the server
name. Its just *a* name the client is aware of - one of many the server
has usually.


&gt;<i> At that point *I think* squid creates a forged cert, then
</I>&gt;<i> creates a new connection to the server, then links together the existing
</I>&gt;<i> client tcp channel with the new proxy-&gt;server tcp channel and carries on
</I>&gt;<i> intercepting (I think that's the outcome - there would have to be some
</I>&gt;<i> extra smoke-n-mirrors in there to make that happen)
</I>
AFAIK, the original server connection is still being used. This is
stage-3. Squid should only have sent enough details to either splice
(original clients details) or bump (Squid faked details).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In pseudo-code, it looks like this
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if http_port and &quot;CONNECT (.*) HTTP&quot; then sni_name=$1
</I>&gt;<i> else if https_port and &quot;peek&quot; then sni_name=find_sni($ipaddress)
</I>&gt;<i> else if https_port then sni_name=$ipaddress
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When all is said and done, transparent HTTPS intercept is the very last
</I>&gt;<i> thing you should be working on. You need to gets squid working 100% as a
</I>&gt;<i> formal proxy - and only then start looking at making that work in
</I>&gt;<i> transparent mode. And you *definitely* want ssl_crtd.
