<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for your extensive replies, it really boosts my understanding of
Squid :-)

&gt;<i> No, because Squid is only aware of two ways to send request - either a
</I>&gt;<i> connection going to the TMG, or a connection going out directly on
</I>port
&gt;<i> 443 to the server (bypassing the TMG). That latter is forbidden by
</I>&gt;<i> firewall rules I presume, and the connection to the TMG is not secured
</I>&gt;<i> for use with <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs.
</I>
Hmm, bummer. I understand your point.
I wonder if it is possible to work around this limitation. It seems like
it is going to look ugly - but for now I am just exploring
possibilities.

For example, would it be possible to use two Squid instances, one to set
up the https connection (&quot;directly&quot; to the internet webservice) and the
second acting as forward proxy to relay all requests from the local
server through the TMG proxy? If some sort of &quot;catch all&quot; configuration
is possible on the second instance, the first instance does not need to
know it as a peer - if you know what I mean.

Alternatively, is it conceivable to use the iptables firewall on the
Squid box (running on RHEL 6.6) to relay traffic through the TMG? So
that Squid would not need any knowledge about this peer, and effectively
thinks it talks directly to the webservice (as required for TLS).

Thanks,
Lucas

Ah. Okay.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Squid will not be able to handle this either unless it is directly

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that if I configure the Squid proxy as a forward proxy and the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Considering the updated diagram, do you think this can be done in Squid?

No, because Squid is only aware of two ways to send request - either a
connection going to the TMG, or a connection going out directly on port
443 to the server (bypassing the TMG). That latter is forbidden by
firewall rules I presume, and the connection to the TMG is not secured
for use with <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs.

In the case where the browser client is sending HTTPS to Squid as a
forward proxy it does so using CONNECT requests. Squid is able to relay
those CONNECT messages to the TMG and you see it working as the tunnel
spans both hops and they are both blind to the HTTPS messages themselves.


If you could TLS encrypt the connection to the TMG Squid could send the
HTTPS messages inside that, but then the TMG would still be the agent
doing the final client-cert bits with the origin server.
