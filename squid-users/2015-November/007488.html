<PRE>Hey Robert,

It is really unclear what you need or want(at least to me).
The basic way that the routing world works is that if you try to access 
an IPV4 address is by using the IPV4 routing world.
It means that you need to use an IPV4 address to access IPV4 resources 
or networks.

I remember talks here and there about making it possible from a routing 
and networking aspect of things to be able to use an IPV6 address to 
access an IPV4 network. From what I know it requires some special 
networking settings and special equipment\software.
In any case you would need somewhere in your setup a place which can 
access either two stacks(IPV4+IPV6) or some other solution which I 
suspect doesn't exist yet.

 From squid aspect it can interact the world with both IPV6 and IPV4 
while the decision is based on the DNS response which is either an A 
record or AAAA record.
If you would use an IPV6 DNS servers the answer would be the same for 
both A and AAAA queries, V4 or V6..
The default from squid point of view is to use it's own IP address while 
accessing the network unless you are using TPROXY.

What you see is how things should work.

All The Bests,
Eliezer Croitoru

&gt;<i> I have an IPv6 outgoing address setup and it works correctly but when I access a website that has an IPv4 address it uses the main IP of the server, is there any way to disable the use of the main IPv4 address of the server and only use the IPv6 outgoing address? I have tried to add only IPv6 DNS nameservers and that didn&#8217;t work. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
