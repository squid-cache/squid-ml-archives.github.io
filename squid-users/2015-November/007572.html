Hi John,

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But problem #1 is another side
effect of the ELB situation. These will also come right back to the same
ELB problems, and the same multiple-ports solution.

Every time you get that NAT failure message from the last issue we
discussed, the requests in that connection will not be cacheable.


As for #2, there is SSL-bump feature in Squid. But for your current
configuration it would be extremely painful to deal with.

Amos
