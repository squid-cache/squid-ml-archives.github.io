Yes, at that point the caching would just work. Modulo any tuning you
want to do.


&gt;<i>  At that point, how

</I>
No more or less hard than it is for anyone else. Still a PITA, but possible.

You would just need to be careful that the connections between the
layers of proxies remains encrypted all the way through your system.
Squid does not support sending secure content out over plain-text links.
