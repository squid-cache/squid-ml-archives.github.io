<PRE>Hi Amos

thanks for your reply.

Yes. Then ... I expected it would make a CONNECT to the upstream proxy 
that would in turn do HTTPS to the target.

I'm happy with the certificate mismatch.

</I>
If my proxy talks TLS with the upstream one - will that do the trick? I 
can upgrade to the latest Squid if that should fix the problem.

However I'm a bit confused with the protocols / certificates involved..

[client] -&gt; HTTPS -&gt; [my_proxy] -&gt; SSL -&gt; [upstream_proxy] -&gt; HTTPS -&gt; 
[target]

What protocol is used between [my_proxy] and [upstream_proxy]? It's not 
CONNECT, is it? Is it TLS connection with something like &quot;GET 
<A HREF="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</A> HTTP/1..&quot; passing through?

Does that also mean the upstream one will have to ssl_bump the 
connection again and re-encrypt with yet another certificate to be able 
to read the target URL? And also - can I pass non-SSL traffic between my 
proxy and the upstream as well?

Can you provide some config hints for both proxies please? The 
SSL-related bits only as that's the unclear part.

Thanks in advance!

Michael
