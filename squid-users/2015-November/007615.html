<PRE>The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-4.0.2 release!


This release is a beta release resolving issues found in the prior Squid
releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Several regression bugs

 - Bug #4356: segmentation fault using proxy_auth ACL
 - Bug #4352: compile errors in OS X 10.11
 - Bug #4351: compile errors when authentication modules disabled
 - Bug #4021: ext_user_regex does exact match

There are also several compile errors with clang which have been
resolved but not in time for this release. To build with clang please
use the latest snapshot package.



* Bug #3574: To avoid crashes, prohibit reconfiguration during shutdown.

This release contains additional fixed for reconfiguration issues during
Squid shutdown sequence.

Note: there are additional shutdown issues yet to be resolved. This only
completes the bug 3574 set of issues surrounding reconfigration signals.



* HTTP/1.1 parser fixes

1xx responses were incorrectly being flagged as final response headers,
eventually leading to the server connection being closed with an abort.
This breaks many PUT transactions, which often rely on
Expect:100-continue feature of HTTP to prevent excessive uploads.

Chunked encoding messages were sometimes not having their terminal bytes
detected properly and causing Squid to abort the transaction and/or the
connection as bad when no actual error had occured.

Note: The new parser also currently rejects URI/URL containing
characters which are not permitted for use in URI due to their dangers
with shell-injection or similar types of attacks. Several major web
services are using such characters anyway. The fix to restore the old
behaviour is still awaiting the final stages of our QA process.



* Re-assign delay pools based on HTTP reply details

The delay_access criteria for delay pools will now be re-assessed on
receipt of a server HTTP response. Meaning it is possible assign pools
based on HTTP reply headers or other server details.

Some initial portion of the response may be received and buffered prior
to the re-assignment happening. That portion will be accounted for in
the earlier request-based pool assignment for the transaction.



 All users of Squid are encouraged to test this release out and plan for
upgrades where possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.
