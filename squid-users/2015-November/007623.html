FYI: &quot;transparently proxy&quot; and what many people used to call
&quot;transparent proxy&quot; are two VERY different things.

&quot;transparently proxy&quot; is something an explicit/forward proxy does. Squid
does that just fine for both HTTP and HTTPS.

&quot;transparent ___ proxy&quot; (note the missing word in the middle of the
name) is what is not easy with HTTPS. Depending on what the missing word
is in your meaning.

As Alex already said peek-and-splice feature should do what you are
asking for. Just make sure you have the latest Squid release that works
for you. The TLS interception features are pretty volatile and things
are still changing pretty rapidly, so keeping it up to date is very
important.
