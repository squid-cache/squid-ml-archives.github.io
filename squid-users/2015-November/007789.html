Hello Eugene,

    Squid currently supports two kinds of CONNECT tunnels:

1. A regular opaque tunnel, as intended by HTTP specifications.

2. An inspected tunnel containing SSL/TLS-encrypted HTTP traffic.

Opaque tunnels are the default. Optional SslBump-related features allow
the admin to designate admin-selected CONNECT tunnels for HTTPS
inspections (of various depth). This distinction explains why and when
Squid expects &quot;HTTPS inside&quot;.

There is currently no decent support for inspecting CONNECT tunnels
other than SSL/TLS-encrypted HTTP (i.e., HTTPS) tunnels.

Splicing a tunnel at SslBump step1 converts a to-be-inspected tunnel
into an opaque tunnel before inspection starts.

The recently added on_unsupported_protocol directive can automatically
convert being-inspected non-HTTPS tunnels into opaque ones in some
common cases, but it needs more work to cover more cases.


AFAICT, you assume that &quot;splicing&quot; turns off all tunnel inspection. This
is correct for step1 (as I mentioned above). This is not correct for
other steps because they happen after some inspection already took
place. Inspection errors that on_unsupported_protocol cannot yet handle,
may result in connection termination and other problems.


If Squid behavior contradicts some of the above rules, it is probably a
bug we should fix. Otherwise, it is likely to be a missing feature.


Finally, if Squid kills your ICQ (non-HTTPS) client tunnels, you need to
figure out whether those connections are inspected (i.e., go beyond
SslBump step1). If they are inspected, then this is not a Squid bug but
a misconfiguration (unless the ACL code itself is buggy!). If they are
not inspected, then it is probably a Squid bug. I do not have enough
information to distinguish between those cases, but I hope that others
on the mailing list can guide you towards a resolution given the above
information.


HTH,

Alex.
