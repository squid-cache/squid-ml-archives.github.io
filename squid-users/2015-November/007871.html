Ouch. Please seriously consider an upgrade. That version is ~10 years
old and does not perform even a handful of modern HTTP protocol needs.
It also has dozens of known security vulnerabilities that cannot and
will not ever be fixed.

Also, when dealing with TLS you will need a current release. Today that
is 3.5.11 or 4.0.2 (beta).

&gt;<i> Purpose:

Okay. This is reverse-proxy / CDN. Absolute minimum Squid version for
properly functioning reverse-proxy is Squid-2.6.


&gt;<i> Squid is configured to communicate with DMS or CA on the behalf of client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part SSL connection authentication mechanism, Squid is sending its
</I>&gt;<i> certificate, which is authenticated by the client which is preloaded with
</I>&gt;<i> the root certificate(issuer of squid certificate).
</I>&gt;<i> So, my query is how to configure mutual authentication where squid asks the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate from the client and authenticates it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The answer to your specific question is easy. Upgrade to a current Squid
and use the clientca= parameter on the https_port.


However, the overall design that you describe trying to achieve is not
possible.

TLS simply does not work that way. The connection from the device/client
is terminated (*terminated*) on entry to Squid. That includes the
validity of the client certificate, if Squid were to try to use that
certificate on its own outgoign connection the certificate would be
*invalid* in TLS terms.

Squid is a *different* client; different hardware, different software,
differetnt TLS connection, different TLS context, different TLS session,
... --&gt; different client certificate.

Things are not completely hopeless though. There is a Certificate
authentication scheme being designed for use in HTTP. Where a end-client
certificate is sent in the HTTP WWW-Auth security credentials. Squid is
already perfectly capable of relaying that at the HTTP level to the
backend servers.
