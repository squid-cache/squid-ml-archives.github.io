<PRE>Thanks fot your reply .

I know that my DNS is weird .

But all I need is
I have access to DNS server , but I don&#8217;t have access to pcs to give them ip:port in their browsers .

So yes , im forced to work on that way .

And I want to filter my websites and the only way to go internet is using the proxy .

So what do you suggest ?

So again , the packet go to squid , but inside this packet the name of websites and ds tip is the proxy ip.

What settings needed on squid to operate such as get the info from name and skip dst ip ?

 If u look @ the log files u will understand my idea

Thanks a lot for reply

cheers

Okay...

&gt;<i> I have a dns to resolve all the websites to the ip of proxy
</I>
Which instructions / documentation did you follow saying that was a good idea?

&gt;<i> I want the proxy to be able to operate normally
</I>
Then, set up your DNS server normally as well :)

&gt;<i> and don't look @ the destination ip since all packet will have the 
</I>&gt;<i> destination ip as the ip of proxy
</I>
I think you have the wrong idea of what &quot;intercept mode&quot; means.

&gt;<i> I want  the proxy to operate based on the domain name.
</I>
So, just route the packets to the proxy (with the *correct* destination IP
address) as per all the guidelines you can find on the Internet showing how to do this, and Squid will do the rest.

&gt;<i> So far I have the squid listenting on port 11611 interept mode and I 
</I>&gt;<i> have traffic 80 , 443 hit the linux proxy server
</I>
You need to perform NAT on the same box as Squid is running on, to redirect packets from their original IP address, to the IP of Squid, and it will work.

Undo the weirdness you've created with DNS.

&gt;<i> Now I cant open either http or https .
</I>
I can only say &quot;I'm not surprised.&quot;  You've told the clients to connect to Squid as a web server.  Squid finds its own IP as the destination, and gives up.

&gt;<i> Squid.conf :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> dns_nameservers 8.8.8.8
</I>
I strongly recommend you to set up a local caching name server, and point both your clients, and Squid, at it.

&gt;<i> visible_hostname seerver.server
</I>
Have you cut and pasted this configuration file, or (mis-)typed it?

&gt;<i> acl localnet src xxx.0.0/16 xxx.0.0/16 192.168.0.0/16    # RFC1918 possible
</I>&gt;<i> internal network
</I>
You have public IPs on your internal network?

Unusual, but plausible...  I'm just checking to make sure I understand your network correctly.

&gt;<i> # Squid normally listens to port 3128
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #http_port 443 intercept
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> http_port 10.159.144.206:11611 intercept
</I>
So, the Squid server has a private IP - this makes it all the more unusual that you seem to have public IPs on your internal network.

&gt;<i> iptables settings :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT 
</I>&gt;<i> --to-destination 10.159.144.206:11611
</I>
That looks fine for a standard intercept setup.

&gt;<i> any help ?????
</I>
Undo your DNS strangeness and let us know if it starts working.

Antony.
