That sounds pretty broken to me (unless the Squid machine really is the web 
server for those sites whose hostname resolves to this IP address).

DNS might be deliberately broken, but it sure isn't working correctly or 
normally.

You have no alternative but to configure the proxy on the clients, then.

As Yuri says, Squid is an HTTP/S proxy - if you tell the clients to use it as 
a proxy (and provided you point Squid itself at a working DNS server), then it 
will work.

If you do not tell the clients to use Squid (ie: you are trying to use it in 
intercept mode) then the clients have to correctly resolve the destination IP, 
and they need to route via the Squid box so that it can intercept the packets.

If neither of those is an available option for you, then Squid can't help deal 
with your very unusual setup.

Antony
