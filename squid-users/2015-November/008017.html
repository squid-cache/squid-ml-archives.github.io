</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Also, be aware the shutdown signal for squid is SIGHUP. If you need to
abort the internal timeout use a second SIGHUP.

So the shutdown process as seen/done by external scripts should be:

* scan squid.conf for unusual pidfile_path and shutdown_lifetime values
* if squid.pid exists; send SIGHUP to process indicated inside
* else locate running squid process and send SIGHUP
* wait desired timeout + a few seconds

* if process still exists; repeat SIGHUP
* wait a few seconds more

* if process still exists; send SIGKILL; repeat until closed
* if squid.pid still exists; rm squid.pid


Notice the two points where waiting &quot;a few seconds more&quot; is needed for
the signals to have effects. That is the time Squid *actually* takes to
shutdown.

The shutdown_lifetime is a grace period where normal proxying operations
are still taking place to try and finish client transactions off. It is
essentially the *minimum* time needed for Squid to shutdown. If you just
abruptly abort/SIGKILL right at the same point where squid should only
be starting to seriousy wind up its own internal actions it can lead
cache and FD problems.
