That has not been true since Squid-3.1. Squid which are HTTP/1.1 enabled
can and do cache dynamic content quite easily.

That depends on what is being tweaked. The options and values that are
marked as violation are so, the others are safe to be adjusted if you
need them.

Yeah we cache so much *more* than 30% nowdays.
Of course ones log analyzer has to notice that the transactions logged
as REFRESH are also cached objects, not only the ones labelled HIT.

Or even if they are downloading different variations of the same object.
For example IE and Firefox request gzip'ed versions, but in different
ways. Chrome requests sdch compressed versions, Safari requests deflated
versions, and robots generally request identity (non-)encoded forms.
Thats up to 5 MISS that will get logged for one object before HITs
become the majority.

Firstly check your config file for these, or some variation of them:
 acl QUERY url_regex cgi-bin \?
 cache deny QUERY

Remove them if you find them. This is how Squid-2 used to deal with
HTTP/1.1 dynamic content in the HTTP/1.0-only proxy. A lot of tutorisals
still exist and say to do it, but that is wrong for current Squid.

Current Squid (3.2+) are all HTTP/1.1 proxies and can safely deal with
caching all that dynamic content properly.

In HTTP/1.0 that would have been the end of it. With the content not
cacheable.

But 1 whole second is a long time and popular auctions might have lots
of visitors during that time.

So in HTTP/1.1 the response *is* cacheable and even re-usable for that
whole second. The server response usually now instructs the proxy cache
to store the object, but do a fast revalidation (REFRESH) query to find
out if it as been changed before using it as a HIT. These get logged as
REFRESH instead of HIT or MISS.

The newer your Squid the better it will be at dealing with modern uses
of HTTP.

Its messy.

There are several issues being reported in the bug 3279 bugzilla entry,
simply because people hit the relatively harmless bug 3279 then they hit
some other more fatal issue and sawy "bug 3279" in the log.

Much like claiming that squid startup process was broken when there was
a malicious request within the first few seconds of startup having
completed. Just because "startup" was mentioned in the log *before* the
failure.


The patch that Yuri and HackXBack are talking about is the fix for bug
3482. Assertion falures saying "!isEmpty" in the log (usually seen 0-5
seconds after a bug 3279). It can be a side effect of bug 3279 having
mucked up the state a little bit, but not always.

That was patched and released months ago in 3.5.6.

*Please* use the latest 3.5 releases. There have been _two_ major
security vulnerability release since 3.5.4. And a great many bug fixes.

Subject: [squid-users] Can not pass Squid basic authentication
Message-ID: <tencent_3A74FE175EF707511EF4A3FE@qq.com>

Hi All,


I have setup basic authentication for Squid, but I can not get passed from browser, just asked to inpu user/password time and time again.


I was stuck at, the command
/usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squid_passwd
dose not give any output. I think it means squid can not get the authentication info. But I have no idea what to do next.


I create my password by
htpasswd -d /etc/squid/squid_passwd dan


My squid config is
auth_param basic program /usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squid_passwd
acl ncsa_users proxy_auth REQUIRED

http_access allow ncsa_users


Could anyone please tell what's wrong with this.
Any help will be highly appreciated!

Subject: [squid-users] Squid ignores crlfile options
Message-ID: <2F3AADF230295040BDC74C6F96094F3D02223A03@SRVEXAFA.verwaltung.afa-ag.loc>

Hi 

I?m using squid (3.5.9) as transparent https proxy with build options (see below) and config (see below , I removed some uninteresting things from the config like caching).

To get the system more secure I would like to add crl checking (at the moment static , later maybe dynamic if it's possible with my skills :-) ) and ocsp (later) .
I?m using the site https://revoked.grc.com/ to test my config.
To do it I downloaded the certificate from the site , checked if a CRL URI is available and downloaded the crl.
Converted the format of the crl from DER to pem and inserted it my squid.conf  "crlfile=/tmp/crl/glob.pem sslflags=VERIFY_CRL".

I tested the "crl.pem" with openssl and the site https://revoked.grc.com/  is revoked in the crl.

But why squid seems to ignore the crlfile option / file ? 
Also I tested to use the crl in DER format but it still wouldn?t work , even didn?t saw an error in the log when the file isn?t available.

Hello,

by reading the 3.5 Squid verson "Peek and splice" features:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice

i would like to ask you two questions, please:

1. in this implementations, i have to install the selfmade Certification Authority as for SSL Bump?
2. how can i block domain (dstdomain with squid) with Peek and Splice? It seems not possible by reading the document

Thank you for your patience and many thanks!

Francesco

Not only by dstdomain, but also with external redirectors:

Thank Yuri!

By opening your png image the accessed domain is visible.
So it is possible to block it in https peek and splice mode?

Thank you again!
Francesco

I think the easiest way for you is to install squid3 via apt-get install
squid3.

It isnt the version 3.5.9 but is 3.5.8.

Because of this occurs in SSL bump mode, inside HTTPS session.

I've found that with peek/splice, instead of stare/bump, I did not need
to install the certificate on the end device (daughter got a new phone
and I forgot to install it...still worked anyway...cool).

Config below for exactly what you're wanting...change netblocks to what
you're using and change cert locations and what not.  Before just doing
a copy/paste and go, I would recommend reading the docs to get a better
understanding of what the below directives mean.  The file http_url.txt
is regex so it will have entries like \.apple\.com.

acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24
acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80
acl Safe_ports port 443
acl CONNECT method CONNECT
acl allowed_http_sites url_regex "/opt/etc/squid/http_url.txt"

http_access deny !Safe_ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports
http_access allow SSL_ports
http_access allow allowed_http_sites
http_access deny all

acl step1 at_step SslBump1
acl step2 at_step SslBump2
acl step3 at_step SslBump3

ssl_bump peek all
acl allowed_https_sites ssl::server_name_regex
"/opt/etc/squid/http_url.txt"
ssl_bump splice allowed_https_sites
ssl_bump terminate all

sslproxy_capath /etc/ssl/certs

sslcrtd_program /opt/libexec/ssl_crtd -s /opt/var/ssl_db -M 4MB

Try using -m instead of -d.

Is that the entire acces control configuration?

If so, it is missing the basic security protections against tunnel abuse
and protocol smuggling. aka;

  http_access deny !Safe_ports
  http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports

These should be above the auth checks to reduce DoS vulnerabilities.

Subject: [squid-users] Basic example for store.log analyzer
Message-ID: <560D336D.4020206@ngtech.co.il>

I already had a plan to write something like that in the past and I had 
some time so I wrote this store.log tool:
http://paste.ngtech.co.il/pr3kbbf4q

The tool is written in ruby and what it does is "estimating" what is in 
the cache_dir now based on reading the store.log.

Since I have not spent too much time on understanding the store.log but 
I had a basic idea of whats in it that seems to give some results for now.

The tool gets only one argument and it's the location of squid store.log 
and reads it like the store "journal" which takes view from nothing to 
what should exit now.
Each line in the store.log represents one operation and it is expected 
to be logger in the order of execution.
Due to this expectation we can predict that if a certain file was 
written to the disk(using SWAPOUT) and until the end of the log(which 
should represent now) it was not reported to be removed(RELEASE) from 
the cache it is still there but there is no guarantee that it will be 
used as a cache HIT.

The tool needs more functionality to be more accurate and to display the 
estimated cache_dir size.
For now running the script piping it with "wc -l"(reduce 1 line) will 
give you the result of how many objects you have in all your cache_dir 
on the server from the start time of the store.log.

Any suggestions and requests regarding the tool are welcome.

Subject: [squid-users] ICAP response header ACL
Message-ID: <560D3895.8030009@opendium.com>


The latest adaption response headers are available through the 
%adapt::<last_h logformat string, but is there any way to access these 
headers through an ACL?

The documentation says that adaptation headers are available in the 
notes, but this only appears to be headers set with adaptation_meta, not 
the ICAP response headers.  I had also considered using the "note" 
directive to explicitly stuff the headers into the notes, but it looks 
like the note directive doesn't allow you to use format strings (i.e. 
"note icap_headers %adapt::<last_h all" just sets the "icap_headers" 
note to "%adapt::<last_h" rather than substituting the headers.)

Because it is only relevant on http(s)_port when there is TLS client
certificate authentication being verified. You do not have that configured.

It is not even loaded unless the clientca= is configured. Which turns on
client cert authentication.


If you mean it to be used to verify the *server* certificates then you
need to configure sslproxy_crlfile instead.

Check your build options (squid -v), your proxy is built to use the
account 'squid'. It is usually a good idea to stick with the

visible_hostname needs to be FQDN and publicly resolvable. It is the DNS
hostname people use to access your proxy for thise icons you configured
(amongst other things).

Remove the above if you want to actually cache much content. Squid has
been okay with caching this stuff since 2.7.

Don't. Really. "all" is a built-in ACL, just use it.

You defined localnet to that already. Meaning you can replace all uses
of "allowed_subnets" with "localnet".

Best practice is now to move all the above http_access lines with their

following...

Seriously? POST and PUT are forbidden to send data anywhere?

Hmm. A delay pool that does not do anything, and every byte of traffic
is processed through it.
Completely useless waste of CPU cycles and memory. Remove all of the
above lines.

You don't use cache_peer. The above line is useless. Remove it.

Do not mix deprecated bumping modes with non-deprecated.
Use "splice" instead of "none" in the above rule...

Then notice that dstdom_regex ACL will not work in ssl_bump. So you may
as well remove the line entirely.

Your peek/splice rules below with "bypass" ACL seem to be doing what you
intended this to do.

Hi again,

Thank you for all the information regarding this matter. Anyhow, I must say
that I changed in my message the origin server to 127.0.0.1 just to not make
public the real address of the origin server but the address that was made
public was the real IP of that origin server which was accesible from the
Internet.

Regards

On Ubuntu it is 3.3.8 still. One needs to upgrade to Debian Testing
repositories for more up to date software.


sawa;
1) your post is not getting responded to until now because you are not
subscribed to the mailing list. Nabble web interface is just a output
display unless you subscribe to the mailing list.

2) that tutorial was outdated a week before it was published. Debian
packages are available since early Aug. The .debs source pkgs can be
used to build a 3.5.7 .deb binary package for your system to install,
including all integration scripts Debian and Ubuntu need.

Both copying [certain] ICAP response headers to annotations and
supporting logformat %codes in the note (and other) directives are
wanted features that nobody has implemented yet. There are similar
features in the existing code (eCAP and request_header_add), so it
should not be a very difficult project. Deciding which headers to copy
and/or adding a configuration option to control that decision may be the
most difficult part.

Please note that the "note" directive is currently evaluated just before
logging. It is not very useful for adding annotations to in-progress
transactions.


HTH,

Alex.

Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP1132846A97E845087706678964C0@phx.gbl>

I have a Squid/Dansguardian proxy server that successfully works when
the client web browser is manually configured to use the proxy address:port.

What I want to do is configure a transparent proxy server, presuming I
wouldn't have to manually configure browsers.

My LAN environment diagram:
http://imgur.com/0MybmwE

This is a home network environment with a cable modem, wifi router,
client web browsers, and I have added the proxy server as a virtualized
VMware server.

For the proxy server I have two virtual network cards on the same subnet:
eth0 192.168.1.14 (gateway and the proxy address)
eth1 192.168.1.15

Is it possible the proxy server can intercept traffic from the clients,
when the clients have direct access to the internet router? I don't
understand how traffic is "intercepted" in this diagram.

Do I need to change something on the router?

How do I configure for proxy transparency?

I've read some configurations, but they were confusing, or out of date,
or specialized without much explanation.

Thanks,
Jake

Dear

I'm using Squid Cache: Version 3.5.9-20150922-r13918 in transparent mode 
with SSL hooked
In my config, i did not bump any site ( just to pass SSL protocol to 
squid in transparent mode)

I'm trying to connect to https://raj2796.wordpress.com

In cache.log

And i'm unable to display the web site, browser is freeze when trying to

How can i bypass this website and force squid to not analyze certificate

"transparent proxy" is not what you think.

The best choice is to use WPAD/PAC auto-configuration. That gets you all
the benefts of manual configuration without the troubles of either
manual or interception.

The router needs to route the packets to/through the proxy server.

The explanation for that is each router software being different. Config
for one routing application will not work for others.

No SSLv3, but SSLv2 is allowed. TLS version negotiation relies on a
range of protocol versions from N to N+x being selectable. If you poke
holes by denying one version in the middle problems arise.

NP: SSLv2 was only removed in Squid-4.

This alone is probably your problem. But there is more you should fix to
prevent later troubles.

With splice none of the ssl_proxy_* options are relevant. Apart from
initial peeking a few bytes the TLS/SSL should be blindly tunnelled
between client and server.

We intend the above config to operate as if the client has sent an
expicit-proxy a CONNECT and Squid without SSL support had received and
enacted it. Sans bugs we have not found yet, that is how 3.5.8 and later
operate.

This tells Squid to use EEC* and EC* ciphers. Squid-3.5 and older do not
support those.

Hi all. Can you help?

When I use the following lines in my squid.conf it works, but it connects to
a local proxy server:

cache_peer 10.185.131.46  parent    3128  3130  proxy-only default
cache_peer 10.185.131.13  sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only

When I use the following destination proxy server it does not work.

cache_peer 10.123.217.82  sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only default

Both the first 2 servers connect to this proxy and are working fine, but as
soon as I link this server to it squid fails to connect. 

Any help will be appreciated.

Notice how the "10.123.*" is on a completely different subnet to the
working peers. It is probably a router or firewall level problem
preventing traffic connecting to that peer.

There are a quite a few broken things in that config. Please update to
the latest Squid version you can, then run "squid -k parse" and fix the
ERROR and WARNING which it reports.

Just a reminder people, but you've gone off-topic. The postbank.de
website issue has NOTHING to do with pining

Someone mentioned earlier it's due to the HTTPS cert not having a
complete cert-chain, and that web browsers auto-correct that situation,
but squid does not. So I would say either squid should:

1. implement the same sort of auto-correction code (say) Firefox does
(which I bet is a lot of work), or
2. flick into splice-mode when there's a cert error (which could be as
much work - I dunno)

I use external_acl_type to call an external script that tries to achieve
that. Basically it manually downloads the homepage to get the cert,
checks if it's valid against the OS CA list and if not, returns ERR so
that squid splice's the connection instead of bump-ing it. Means the
entire connection blocks of course the first time this occurs, but after
that caches it and it mostly works.

I'm not sure but a custom certificate validator helper can probably do
all this better. An example helper in Perl can be found at
helpers/ssl/cert_valid.pl

That website worked for me because my external validator had an
exception rule for valid certs containing "bank" (which makes it "ERR" -
causing squid to splice it instead of bump it). To see this problem for
myself I removed that check and indeed bump-ing then failed to work
(squid-3.5.10)

I then pointed sslabs.com at that site and it got a "B" rating and
there's no obvious signs of a cert error - so I can't figure out what is
going wrong. I've manually downloaded the server cert using "openssl
s_client" and the cert chain validates just fine - so what is squid
doing to it? Weird...

I'm suspecting the order of these options screws things up. Or maybe
just the use of "ALL".

Thanks Amos for the reply ,

I will trim the config with your recommendations but a few questions exists on my side.

" If you mean it to be used to verify the *server* certificates then you need to configure sslproxy_crlfile instead."

	I guess that was what im looking for :-) , 
	but I couldn?t find something about that configuration directives on the squid doc configuration site and my squid ignores the options
	because its unrecognized.

"> request_body_max_size 0 KB

Seriously? POST and PUT are forbidden to send data anywhere?"

	Should the value be ignored because it?s a zero ?
	Here the part of the Squid configuration document 
		"If you set this parameter to a zero (the default), there will be no limit imposed."

" build-info requires a string. Whoever provided this package needs to fix that."
	I was the builder :-) , could you give me a hint about that ?

Mit freundlichen Gr??en / Best Regards

Sebastian

Because it is only relevant on http(s)_port when there is TLS client certificate authentication being verified. You do not have that configured.


> Also I tested to use the crl in DER format but it still wouldn?t work , even didn?t saw an error in the log when the file isn?t available.

It is not even loaded unless the clientca= is configured. Which turns on client cert authentication.


If you mean it to be used to verify the *server* certificates then you need to configure sslproxy_crlfile instead.

This is a default, remove the icp_port line.

This is a default, remove the pid_filename line.

Check your build options (squid -v), your proxy is built to use the account 'squid'. It is usually a good idea to stick with the

visible_hostname needs to be FQDN and publicly resolvable. It is the DNS hostname people use to access your proxy for thise icons you configured (amongst other things).

This is probably a default too, if so remove the pinger lines. It will run unless disabled.

Remove the above if you want to actually cache much content. Squid has been okay with caching this stuff since 2.7.

Don't. Really. "all" is a built-in ACL, just use it.

You defined localnet to that already. Meaning you can replace all uses of "allowed_subnets" with "localnet".

Best practice is now to move all the above http_access lines with their slow and DoS-vulnerable ACL processing down below the CONNECT line following...

Hmm. A delay pool that does not do anything, and every byte of traffic is processed through it.
Completely useless waste of CPU cycles and memory. Remove all of the above lines.

You don't use cache_peer. The above line is useless. Remove it.

> ssl_bump none whitelist

Do not mix deprecated bumping modes with non-deprecated.
Use "splice" instead of "none" in the above rule...

Then notice that dstdom_regex ACL will not work in ssl_bump. So you may as well remove the line entirely.

Your peek/splice rules below with "bypass" ACL seem to be doing what you intended this to do.

Hello,

i was trying the "null" storage module in Squid 3.4.x.
I have some systems with huge users and with high traffic peaks expecially during the morning.

We use Squid to filter internet traffic.

Do you think that enabling the cache_dir null will give us better performances and less system usage?

Thank you!

I have installed squid 3.5 on Win2K12 and it is working fine.  The next step is to enable AD auth and apply an ACL for groups. All the documentation for AD auth is geared towards linux. Are there are docs/guides for doing this on Windows?

...but I don't even use sslproxy_options.... There have been at least 3
people saying that bump doesn't work with that site - we all won't have
identical configs.

Chrome reports "ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED" and Firefox "The connection to
banking.postbank.de was interrupted while the page was loading." - that
doesn't even sound cert-related - more TCP related (between client and
squid). Remember: the site works fine when squid is set to splice that site

I have compared the fake cert generated by squid against the real one
and there's obvious differences (using "openssl s_client -connect
banking.postbank.de:443 -servername banking.postbank.de|openssl x509
-noout -text"). References to "Certificate Policies" and "Certificate
Transparency" are present in the real cert and there's no equivalent in
the Fake cert. How that could trigger a TCP reset is beyond me? I've
also cranked up logging and there was nothing overt showing an issue

Sorry. I keep forgetting that one is not supported in Squid-3.

You will need Squid-4 with:
 tls_outgoing_options crlfile=/...

Maybe yes, maybe no. Sometimes our documentation is out of data and we
are moving to a model where "none" (the word) means no limits.

If you want the default, remove it from the config file. That goes for
almost all directives in Squid-3.

It is a string for branding, or adding a custom sentence to squid -v
output. Major distros use it to label their builds clearly in a way
separated from the release version. Some of my clients use it to label
what their custom patching was applied to the build.

If you dont set it to a string like --enable-build-info="something" it
is not useful and can be removed entirely.

It does not exist.

Squid-3 does proper memory-only caching by default. Just erase or
comment out all cache_dir lines in your config and it works.

RAM is faster than disk. This is a bast fact of I/O.

Eliminating the disk from the proxying system changes the I/O needs.
Whether that switch is a latency gain or loss depends on your traffic.

If your network is faster than the disks you were using; then it may
have some gain, otherwise not.

The connection arriving at Squid does not have any NAT records in the
Squid machine kernel.

It is mandatory that NAT be done on the Squid machine. Not on some
remote router (aka CPE "port-forwarding").
 <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/LinuxDnat>


It is mandatory that you *not* test NAT ports by configuring your
browser to use the proxy via it. Configure the testing browser the same
way teh cleints woudl be tested.

The SSPI helpers are Windows native intergration.

Though, Cygwin is trying to emulate Linux/POSIX on Windows so I'm not
sure which set of helpers are required there. Diladele may be able to help.

Those bits how the origin certificate to be an EV (Extended Validation)
certificate issued by Symantec. That could be causing trouble. I've not
looked into EV in particular detail, but it is supposed to be one of the
better ways to use TLS to prevent MITM like ssl-bump.


Also, Symantec have had a unusually large amount of trouble getting
certain of their CA certs to stay in the global trusted set. Something
to do with the clients they vouch for turning out to be bad, and again,
and again.
 Anyhow, there have been long periods (12-18 months IIRC) where they
were not trusted as a global CA. If your CA certificates set is from one
of those periods your Squid will not be able to verify trust of the
origin cert.

Should that show up in the logs somewhere? Put it this way: we have a
situation where "something" is causing a website that works without bump
to not work with it. If squid doesn't "like" something, could it
"auto-splice" - or at the very least log that there's a problem?

I'd like to find out what squid doesn't like about it because I could
probably update my external_acl_type script to detect that situation and
make squid splice the session (BTW my script already verifies the real
cert using the same CAs file that squid uses and it says it's legit - so
I don't think it's actually got anything to do with the CA itself)

Hi, thanks for those points.

Changed the config, remove all unecessaries config and upgrade to Squid 
3.5.10 did not resolve the issue.
Web site still not browseable...

Notice that using a non-transparent port on Squid allow the site to be 
displayed without any issue..

FTP gateway has been supported since Squid-2.4 or something.

FTP relay/proxying is what what added in Squid-3.5.


NOTE:
"Transparency" is a protocol defined set of requirements in HTTP. It
does not mean anything like what most people use the word to mean.

FTP does not even define a role for proxying, so does not define what
would be necessary for proxy to act transparently. We made an educated
guess and implemented that. It seems to work.

Hello,

does anybody know if squid does certificate checks and how to tell squid 
to do so;

this is a site with a revoked certificate
https://revoked.grc.com/

without squid, the browser shows that the certificate is revoked and 
doesn't show the page
with squid, the page is shown ...

Thanks,

Hi Amos, thanks a lot for your reply.


I have tried both -m and -d for htpasswd, they do generate different encrypted text, but none of them can be recognized by /usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth.
I am still stuck at here.


By the way, I just paste the diff part of my config between the default config. So my config contains these 2 lines:
  http_access deny !Safe_ports
  http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports

Try using -m instead of -d.

Is that the entire acces control configuration?

If so, it is missing the basic security protections against tunnel abuse
and protocol smuggling. aka;

  http_access deny !Safe_ports
  http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports

These should be above the auth checks to reduce DoS vulnerabilities.

It seems there?s no way to get the equivalent of the `dst` internal ACL into an external ACL. %DST returns the hostname from DNS not the origin IP. 

Am I missing something? Perhaps there's a more creative way to pass the IP to an external ACL regardless of what the hostname is?

Hello Amos!

>> i was trying the "null" storage module in Squid 3.4.x.

>It does not exist.

excuse me for my misunderstood: i was referring to this for the "null module".
Is it right?

Can I make Squid proxy only, without caching anything?
Sure, there are few things you can do. 
You can use the cache access list to make Squid never cache any response: 
cache deny all
With Squid-2.7, Squid-3.1 and later you can also remove all 'cache_dir' options from your squid.conf to avoid having a cache directory. 
With Squid-2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.0 you need to use the "null" storage module: 
cache_dir null /tmp
Note: a null cache_dir does not disable caching, but it does save you from creating a cache structure if you have disabled caching with cache. The directory (e.g., /tmp) must exist so that squid can chdir to it, unless you also use the coredump_dir option. 
To configure Squid for the "null" storage module, specify it on the configure command line: 
--enable-storeio=null,...

There was a product that perform this way called Frox
http://frox.sourceforge.net/

But this project did not support modern kernels.
Currently create iptables rules on 21 port and forward to squid port did 
not working.
FTP clients turn to timed out..

The iptables gateway is in the same machine where Squid+SSL bump run.

Our transparent proxy for 80/HTTP works perfectly, but users cannot access do https pages.

By consolle, if i telnet localhost 3129 (https intecept port), i have no connections, even though in netstat -avn | grep 3129 i have active and listening connections.

Please note i use the REDIRECT --to-port command in iptables.

Where am i wrong?

Thank you!

Since there is a bug in the store.log this a fixed version of the tool:
http://paste.ngtech.co.il/pll97qera

The bug is that the cache_mem should not be reported on each memory 
store object release inside the store.log since the store.log is for 
cache_dir only.
The difference between a cache_dir and a memory object release is the 
file number(the 4 argument in a log line) which is "FFFFFFFF" for memory 
object and lower for a regular cache_dir such as ufs.

Eliezer

Message-ID: <CA+86yMiq4bJ9jBAusPPYpp9=qC4S0zoNcFf_ZMg9dyT40dUJWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
With the help of Squid I want to return a custom payload for 404 response
returned from web server. I have configured below acl to achieve the same

acl denied_status_404 http_status 404
deny_info  http://errorpage.com denied_status_404

with the above configuration squid is sending 302 redirection to client
browser . But I want squid to retain the same http status code (404) when
responds back.
Basically I want to modify  only the payload of the webserver response with
same 404 status code.
I know this can be achieved in squid version 3.2. But our server is running
with squid version 3.1.20 . Is there any way we can achieve this in squid
3.1?

Does the below configuration work?

acl denied_status_404 http_status 404 rep_mime_type -i ^text/html
deny_info  http://errorpage.com denied_status_404

Now squid the squid is spoofing all the 404 responses irrespective of
content type(html/javascript). I don't want squid to spoof the 404 response
received from API payload.
Does squid classify the difference between a webpage and API payload?

Regards,
Saravanan N

Some OCSP responders need the host header, try adding:

Good catch - I don't think squid does CRL/OCSP checks

I'm using the external_acl_type method to achieve that: it does the
extra work and returns "ERR" for revoked certs - which (for me) causes
squid to fallback on splice mode - so that the client browser can see
the actual fault directly (ie I'm making sure revoked certs are never
bumped)

But this is a bug in squid - this means untrustworthy certs become
trusted again - not a good look

Hello,

can you please provide an example of how to use this in squid.conf

by the way how would I use these

sslcrtvalidator_program
and
sslcrtvalidator_children

Thanks,
Walter

Subject: [squid-users] Host header forgery detected after upgrade from 3.5.8
	to 3.5.9
Message-ID: <cone.1444132533.283107.14341.1000@bollix>

Hi everyone,

I have a Squid setup on a linux box with transparent interception of both  
http and https traffic. Everything worked fine with Squid 3.5.6. After  
upgrading to version 3.5.10, I get many warnings about host header forgery:

  SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected on local=104.46.50.125:443 remote=192.168.9.126:52588 FD 22 flags=33 (local IP does not match any domain IP)
  SECURITY ALERT: By user agent:
  SECURITY ALERT: on URL: nexus.officeapps.live.com:443

These warnings all seem to occur for https web sites that use multiple DNS  
records. The warnings coincide with the fact that the clients are unable to  
get the requested page.

I've read the wiki page http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery
and I can assert that:
- we do NAT on the same box that is running Squid
- both squid and the clients use the same DNS server

I've also tested 3.5.9, and this version also showed these warnings.
Version 3.5.7 worked fine, and 3.5.8 did too.

So, one of the changes in 3.5.9 caused this behaviour.

Can anyone shed some more light on this? Is this a problem in my setup that  
surfaced with 3.5.9, or is it a problem in Squid?

Thanks a lot for any help,

Roel

Why no mem cache exactly? this is might be a side effect of these settings.
There was some email about it in squid-dev in the past but I am unsure 
what it was.
First try to use 4MB instead of 0MB and then I think you can look for a 
bugzilla report and\or report one at:
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/index.cgi

You do not need to use cache_mem 0 GB when you deny all.

Hi everyone,

I have successfully set up reverse proxy and ICP communication between 
siblings. I'd like to encrypt cache sharing between siblings, but cannot 
figure out the optimal solution for this. I have not found from 
documentation, how to do ssl encryption between cache_peer hosts so that 
cache objects are transferred securely over the Internet.

It works like this: local http client connects to squid with plain http, 
squid acts as https client for remote server, fetches objects and stores 
them into cache. The question is, how to fetch objects from sibling 
caches with ssl and minimal overhead?

My current test system configuration (replaced hostnames with foobar, 
the second test sibling just has y.y.y.y ip address in configuration):

IIRC, Squid relies on OpenSSL to perform CRL checks. OpenSSL is
difficult to configure to do CRL checks. If my recollection is correct,
then this is not exactly a Squid bug but more like a missing convenience
feature.

Squid does not know about OCSP. Another missing feature.

One may perform all those checks using a custom certificate validator
helper, of course.

I have a Squid Version 3.9.Stable13 which is working perfect.

Today I received a complanint of a users which is not able to browse a
brazilian site.

Squid log shows no DENY at all but the site only shows a white screen with
no errors.

I thought this was a site bug. So I set up a NAT to the user and for my
surprise the site worked flawless.

The site seems to user ports http(80) / https(443) and http(9080) all
theses are not blocked by Squid.

What could be the cause to this site not work through Squid.

Message-ID: <CAPHJSn0QkaJ7tFndTYmRaPRWUdmDpQ-qY9M3C6k0_GrzViz+6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Just a quick question regarding SSL bump and ICAP.

I have integrated Squid 3.5.9 with a commercial product that provides
an ICAP service. It works fine for HTTP.

Upon recieving an ICAP query for a blocked HTTP site the following
ICAP response is returned.

ICAP/1.0 200 OK
ISTAG: "PRODUCTNAME"
Attribute: Blocked Sites
Encapsulated: res-hdr=0, null-body=148

HTTP/1.0 302 Moved
Location: http://192.168.0.10/block?session=12345678
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

and the block page is correctly displayed in the users browser

However, when accessing a blocked site over HTTPS the following ICAP
response is received:

ICAP/1.0 200 OK
ISTAG: "PRODUCTNAME"
Attribute: Blocked Sites
Encapsulated: res-hdr=0, null-body=533

HTTP/1.0 403 Blocked
Content-Type: text/html
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Location: http://192.168.0.10/block?session=12345678

<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh"
content="0;url=http://192.168.0.10/block?session=12345678">
    <title>Blocked</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h4>You have been blocked.</h4>
    <p>Click <a
href="http://192.168.0.10/block?session=12345678">here</a> for
details</p>
  </body>
</html>

Chrome and IE just error upon receiving this response. In the case of
Chrome I get an ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED error. I could be wrong
but I would imagine this error is by design, as Chrome will only
respond to a proxy authentication request or SSL handshake in response
to a HTTP CONNECT?

If that's correct, I was wondering if there is a way to get this to
work, with peek and splice possibly or any alternative method?

Thank you

Paul

That's a bit hard for us to tell without knowing:

 - the site the user was trying to access (so we can see what sort of HTML it 
returns, or try it on our own Squid setups, for example)

 - your Squid configuration (so we can see why the access ought to have worked)

 - what showed up in the Squid log file when the user tried to access the site 
(so we can see what Squid was asked to do, what it did, and what the result 
was).


I suggest you:

 - tell us the URL

 - post your squid.conf without blank lines or comments (obscuring any 
sensitive data, if present)

 - post the Squid access log for the session (removing detail from any other 
sessions so long as you're sure they are unrelated).


That may give us some useful information to work on.


Regards,


Antony.

Hey Paul,

 From what I have seen until now I believe that the ICAP service 
response is for a CONNECT request.
 From security reasons browsers are not allowing or rather then not 
implanting support for a direct HTTP response to a CONNECT(tunnel) requests.
This is why you see this reaction from the browsers.
using peek and splice would not change the behavior of the browsers and 
client and there for it will not change anything for this specific scenario.

However you can implement the inspection on the https level and not the 
CONNECT level which would work.
If somehow you will find the right way to pass or to not pass CONNECT 
requests to the ICAP service you might get to a situation which the 
CONNECT by itself is allowed(and not inspected by the ICAP service) and 
peek+splice would bump the connection and then the adaption(ICAP) 
service will analyze the wrapped http level inside the CONNECT request.
This way the browser will receive the ICAP service response on the http 
level and will show to the client the block page.

I know it is possible and Diladele solution does that already so there 
is some light for you.

The issue is that I have not implemented it yet and there for cannot 
give you instructions on how to implement it.

Yes, this is by ["lazy"] browsers design (not specific to Chrome or IE).

Yes, you have a few options:

1. Do not block CONNECT. Block the HTTP request after CONNECT instead.
This does not require Squid modifications, but may require ICAP service
modifications, including keeping state between HTTP requests.


2. If you do not care about the actual error message displayed to the
user OR are OK with using [customizable] Squid error messages instead of
the ICAP-generated error messages, then you may:

2a. Teach Squid to treat certain ICAP responses as an instruction to
"block the virgin HTTP message". Squid eCAP client already supports that
(see 2d below). Squid ICAP client needs more work, including a decision
on how to define those "certain responses" in the ICAP context (should
probably be done via a new ACL-driven squid.conf directive).

2b. Teach the ICAP service to allow the CONNECT request but add an
extension HTTP header to it. Use adapted_http_access to block the
adapted CONNECT request.

2c. Teach Squid to use non-standard ICAP response headers as transaction
annotations (eCAP can do that already). Use adapted_http_access to block
the CONNECT transaction with your "blocking" annotations.

2d. Switch from ICAP to eCAP and use the existing
libecap::host::Xaction::blockVirgin() API. This option does not require
Squid development.


3. If you must use ICAP-generated error messages and cannot use option
#1 above, then you can do either #2a or #2d _and_ also teach Squid to
save and serve the custom error message returned by the adaptation
service. This option requires [very] difficult Squid development work
(in addition to easier development work required by #2a), but it is
possible.


All of the above options require bumping the connection. There is no
other way to serve an error message to the user (because of the browsers
design).

In the above text, "teach X to do Y" means "modify X code to
[optionally] do Y", including finding somebody who can perform those
source code modifications for you if needed.

I believe the above options are reasonable/valid, but I have not tested
any of them with a recent stock Squid. YMMV.


HTH,

Alex.

Subject: [squid-users] authentication setup for squid-internal-mgr
Message-ID: <CAEaSS0YvAcgmaF_tz=E80RFsC3WGBjKHp=Qv_7NiCP8zzKtMYw@mail.gmail.com>

So I was playing with squid-internal-mgr (replacement for cachemgr.cgi it
seems), but I have no real authentication access , other than my ACL's

acl manager url_regex -i ^cache_object:// +i
^https?://[^/]+/squid-internal-mgr/


And limited to my networks obviously.

But as of now those pages are wide open, so anyone could go to /menu and
see /shutdown and type that in and bingo bango my squid server is shutdown.


So was wondering if there is a way to make some of these pages require
authentication? I'm not clear what "public" means in each instance below,
sooo..


Thanks

Tory

Hi Antony.

The URL is www..yasudamaritima.com.br, but according to the user, you have
to navigate and authenticate to the portion of the site which is supposed
to show the window, but the window is blank.

Hey,

I assume you are not using default squid.conf since what you are 
describing is not squid default settings from sources.
You can use basic auth and others to protect this page.
What have you tried until now?
Can you share your squid.conf so it will make more sense?

Thanks Alex, Dieter & Eliezer

I've been trying to prevent the CONNECT request being processed by
ICAP and the following configuration in Squid 3.5.9 alongside a
standard SSL peek and splice config appears to work:

acl CONNECT method CONNECT
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

adaptation_access service_req deny CONNECT
adaptation_access service_req allow all

Although I haven't tested this thoroughly yet, it appears to allow the
initial tunnel creation but allow filtering of subsequent requests
within those tunnels. Although I guess this will only work for bumped
connections.

Thanks

Paul

Hello Paul, Eliezer, Alex,

We (diladele ICAP) have an open bug /feature requests for this:
	https://github.com/ra-at-diladele-com/qlproxy_external/issues/731
	https://github.com/ra-at-diladele-com/qlproxy_external/issues/726

As Alex described most probably we will do the 2b approach - although the work has not started yet.
Hope to be able to have something by the end of this year!

P.S. The http://docs.diladele.com/faq/squid/cannot_connect_to_site_using_https.html describes why the blocked message is not shown in simple words.

Best regards,
Rafael Akchurin
Diladele B.V.

#create external acl checker that returns "ERR" or "OK" based on cert
data sent to it
external_acl_type checkIfHTTPS children-max=20 concurrency=20
negative_ttl=3600 ttl=3600 grace=90  %SRC %DST %PORT %ssl::>sni

#only bump SSL transactions that return "OK"
ssl_bump bump is_ssl


Then the script is passed srcIP, dstHostname|dstIP (depends on whether
this is a CONNECT or transparent proxy), port (probably 443) and the SNI
value (if present)

My script does a bunch of checks, and now includes downloading the
server cert, scraping it for CRL data, downloads the CRL file and
compares the cert's serial number against that CRL - hence discovering
if it's revoked or not

The script can differentiate between non-SSL, SSL, HTTPS and
HTTPS-to-whitelisted-sites,HTTPS-with-self-signed,
HTTPS-with-untrusted-CA, HTTPS-with-client-cert, HTTPS-with-CRL-check -
in all these "failure" cases it returns "ERR" - which causes squid to
NOT bump the connection and instead splice it. End result is squid only
bumps sessions it can successfully and safely bump, and applications
like Gtalk, Skype, and regex-whitelisted sites work  without human
intervention - leaving only cert pinning as the only manual process
(because these cannot be detected - only the application "knows" if it's
pinned)

The 2b) option a.k.a "simply always allow the CONNECT www.example.com and
later block GET https://www.example.com/index.html" _only_ works for
correctly SSL-bumped sites and does not work sites that do not use SSL+HTTP.

For Skype, SSH tunnels and other protocols that also use CONNECT
the ICAP server must block the CONNECT (if configured to do so).
There are even sites that use SSL+other protocol, so bumping such site may
initially seem OK since the SSL handshake was done without problems,
but since it is not followed by an HTTP protocol request, the ICAP server
will never see a followup HTTP GET/POST and hence will never be able to
block the site after it allowed the CONNECT.
So if the site must be blocked, the ICAP server must already decide what
to do when it receives a CONNECT request:
a) guess that the CONNECT is for SSL+HTTP, pass the CONNECT and wait for the followup GET/POST to be blocked, or
b) guess that the CONNECT is for a site that does not use SSL+HTTP and block the CONNECT.

Because of the above, I had a discussion a long time ago with the Squid developers
to extend Squid to send the (non-HTTP) content to the ICAP server in case
that the CONNECT tunnel does not have SSL+HTTP, but the implementation effort
was considered to be too much at that time.
If, however, this feature is implemented, the ICAP server no longer has to guess
and can always pass the CONNECT and decide later, knowing that it will either
receive an HTTP request or the non-HTTP content.

Marcus

Hi Jason,

This sounds like an interesting script. Do you want to make this public?
And what about sites that use HSTS, can you also do a "GET /" and check
the headers for HSTS?

Frankly it's a "script as you learn" type affair - it's not in any fit
state to be released to the public - probably lead to a compromise ;-)

However, as several people have asked for it, can I "formally" ask if
anyone on this list has anything better? If not I could try to clean it
up and release it.

But I'm no gun programmer - so I'd rather someone more competent did it
if possible ;-)

If you want the user to see a non-browser error message, then _all_ of
those options require bumping, SSL, and HTTP (all three!). They only
differ in where the error message originates (Squid, ICAP, or eCAP) and
the associated development effort (if any).

A bumping Squid will essentially block the site in such cases though
(subject to on_unsupported_protocol controls in recent Squids).

Recent Squids also have options for detecting non-HTTP and non-SSL
traffic (see the on_unsupported_protocol directive in squid.conf).

What do you mean? Too much implementation effort to implement quickly?
... to implement for free? ... to implement in the next release?
Something else?

In general, improvements in Squid's non-SSL and non-HTTP content
handling should be welcomed and adaptation services may be used for that
IMO, especially when it comes to custom error generation.

Okay. -m should have worked. All I can suggest then is trying to get a
newer version of Squid. The NCSA helper is now called basic_ncsa_auth.

For 3.1 this can only be done with ICAP filtering of the messages.

I have a patch for Squid-4 in squid-dev to make external ACL formats
take any of the logformat codes. If you want to test it out please do.

We have had a few reports of beaviour similar to this with SSL-Bump.
Those turned out to be the fact that SSL contexts and sessions have a
huge amount of memory state associated with them that does not get
released for the lifetime of the connection. Also contexts are not
shared between workers, so in your config there will be 6x the memory
use for contexts.

Please check if the memory goes down when all connections to the proxy
are closed. Or if there is some (possibly many GB) amount where it
levels off.

If you still think its a leak after checking that, please try to locate
a build with valgrind support. The bugzilla report will need the output
from a run with valgrind.

Same way you configured it for the parent proxy. What makes you think it

Apart from the favicon, which is inconsequential those transactions all
are successful (2x and 3xx status) and appear to have completed
properly. Some of the CONNECT's are staying active for several minutes
though, so the ones listed are unlikely to be related to the request at
the top, and if there were any they could close much later than the log
shows.

Looks very much okay.


Which leaves us with the troublesome issues like path-MTU discovery
problems. If there is a CONNECT happening but some payload data packets
not getting through you could end up with missing page parts.

Or maybe, server application not coping with proxied traffic. I've seen
some that simply crash the backend server script engine if you pass it a
X-Forwarded-For header with non-IPv4 contents.

Or maybe, the window was supposed to contain something over a non-HTTP
protocol that is broken.

I believe the word is "Meh.". This is one of the expected use-cases for
CacheMgr. ie how the new access methods are designed to be used.

Strictly speaking its anyone who can access those reports. You just have
one less layer of protection than default installs use.

"public" means there is no report-specific password set by
cachemgr_passwd directive required to access it. The only control will
be the http_access rules you configure.


You create a urlpath_regex ACL to match regular (not squidclient or
cachemgr.cgi) requests for the reports like so:

 acl foo urlpath_regex \
    ^/squid-internal-mgr/(shutdown|reconfigure|rotate|offline_toggle)

Authentication can be applied in combination with that to do whatever
reports you want authenticated. Also group limitations, external ACL,
specific src IPs, etc..

First; discover whether man-in-middle decryption is legal for your

Exactly. All thats missing is the squid.conf directive in Squid-3.x.
That has been added in Squid-4.

Sure.

Look at the typical fb URL:

http://i.imgur.com/3xQxD1z.png

It uses Akamai CDN and, without store-id, you will got MUCH duplicates 
for the same content.

And only with stire-ID you have a chance to get HIT:

I have been using squid 3.4 for about 1 year now and everything was going fine up until a couple days ago when users started seeing access denied errors for some reason. I currently have around 900 active users all with their own src authentication IPs. I use a seperate folder for the users files and include them into the squid.conf file. Is there a maximum number of src IPs or include files inside the squid.conf? Maybe I have reached a limit somehwere. In the past I?ve had a?hiccup here and there and always found the error or problem plain as could be in the cache.log but this time I cannot find the error. I?m stumped and turning to the community for the first time. Any help or recommendations would be greatly apreciated.

Hey Robert,

If you have an access_denied then something should show up in the 
access.log.
It is pretty hard to tell from what it comes if the settings are unknown.
If you have about 900 users and it's static then using using conf files 
is fine.
But it it's a dynamic application, you should consider to use an 
external_acl helper which will test the src IP against some key\value DB.
It will remove the complexity of squid configuration and will allow you 
a more flexible solution.

Usually the way to solve this kind of issue is to use squid debug 
capabilities:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/DebugSections
Section 28 should shed some light on the issue.

    I thought that there were something broken is the workstation like old
Java or missing flash... A part of been tested in more than one
workstation, I NATed one of the workstation, by passing Squid, and it
worked flawless, so I ruled out something missing/broken.

    I put a log on the firewall to check whether the site have a Java which
was trying a connection without proxy but nothing came up.

    Any idea on what else can I try or look for?

Hi Fred,

Good news!  Can you say what are the numbers behind "significantly reduced" ?

Could you put a packet capture on that workstation's IP address to check for 
all traffic going to/from it:

	a) without the proxy (NATted), works

	b) with the proxy, fails

and see if you can spot some significant difference?

Hello,

i can intercept SSL Bumped connection actually.

But in squid logs i have this error, and clients disolay a squid error page.

These are the logs:

How can i resolve this?

Hi Amos!

Resolved: in squid.conf i have to write ip:port instead of :port.
As example, 192.168.10.254:3129 works with interception.

Only with :3129 it does not works!

Oggetto: [squid-users] R:  SSL Bump and NF getsockopt failed

Hello Amos!

>The connection arriving at Squid does not have any NAT records in the

>It is mandatory that NAT be done on the Squid machine. Not on some
>remote router (aka CPE "port-forwarding").

The iptables gateway is in the same machine where Squid+SSL bump run.

Our transparent proxy for 80/HTTP works perfectly, but users cannot access do https pages.

By consolle, if i telnet localhost 3129 (https intecept port), i have no connections, even though in netstat -avn | grep 3129 i have active and listening connections.

Please note i use the REDIRECT --to-port command in iptables.

Where am i wrong?

Thank you!
Francesco

Hi Marcus,

Load average reduced, at least, by two ( 5 -> 2) CPU usage -+ 20% reduced, no memory difference 
Caution, no difference at all with a low load, perhaps with less than 200 or 300 r/s  

When the proxy was stressed the branch 3.5.x was (for me) more "slow" than 3.4.x, it's not true now 

Regards 

Fred

Hi Amos,

what about these two directives in squid.conf?

sslcrtvalidator_program and sslcrtvalidator_children

or

sslcrtvalidator_program cache=8192 ttl=240 /usr/lib64/squid/cert_valid.pl
sslcrtvalidator_children 12 startup=5 idle=1 concurrency=1

can I have a working sample of valid_cert.pl that results
in an "access denied" or any other error page of squid?
(it may bring this on any page that is ssl_bumped,
so I know the interface, because this here:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslServerCertValidator
is wrong;

instead of
/usr/lib64/squid/cert_valid.pl
I used a bash-script with this content

#!/bin/bash

myprog 2>>/tmp/pre.log |/usr/lib64/squid/cert_valid.pl

and the C source of myprog:


#include<fcntl.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main( int argc, char* argv[ ] )
{
         static char szBuf[ 260 ];
         int nLen;
         while( ( nLen = read( 0, (void*) szBuf, 256 ) )>  0 )
         {
                 write( 1, (void*) szBuf, nLen );
                 write( 2, (void*) szBuf, nLen );
         }
         return 0;
}

so I got the ident content as stdout and stderr and there I catched e.g. this:

<CATCH CONTENT>

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</CATCH CONTENT>

with this I could programme a correct certificate validator using OpenSSL,
but I MUST have a little bit more precise knowledge about the correct interface;

can someone please explain how the 3373 of the CATCH CONTENT above is calculated?

and how the following could deal in connection with this certificate validator

acl certHasExpired ssl_error X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED
acl certNotValid ssl_error X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID
acl certRevoked ssl_error X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED

sslproxy_cert_error deny certRevoked
sslproxy_cert_error deny certHasExpired
sslproxy_cert_error deny certNotValid
sslproxy_cert_error allow all

the generic fake sample /usr/lib64/squid/cert_valid.pl

returns always "0 OK 0 \1"
what does \1 mean here?

Thanks,
Walter

Hi,

sorry it took me so long to test this. I confirm the ruleset you suggest
accomplishes my goals.

They are the configuration of that custom helper Alex mentioned. The one
bundled with Squid does not do those checks either AFAIK. But should be
easily modifiable if you know Perl.

An ERR result from the helper should result in the invalid certificate
handling happening in Squid. Whether that results in a particular error
page (or not) depends on several things I'm not completely certain about.

Ah. I see the concurrency channel is not documented, but is being sent.
What Squid version are you using?

This helper is broken. The protocol here or even other helpers, has
never been to dump the input back to Squid.
Input and output "lines" have different syntax and contents.

Documented in the wiki:
"Total size of the following request bytes taken by the key=pair
parameters."

That is the byte size of the "host=...END CERTIFICATE-----" key-pair
part of the message.

The first '0' is concurrency channel ID. It is just an echo of the
channel-ID received on the request.

The other fields are as documented in the wiki. In this example there
are no key-pair values being sent back to Squid. Thus the "0" in the
size field.

\1 is the binary code (0x01) for end of line/message this helper
requires. We cannot use \n like other helpers since several \n are part
of the cert PEM format.

Message-ID: <CABrZ10z6PvAmXaYb0HSBgGV3CTPu1vkc730+9guP7bHaBKY8pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have squid 3.1 installed using ldap authentication. When i access a
browser i enter my ldap credentials and it works fine. I?m able to browse
all sites without any issues.


Is there a way to use ldap groups to allow certain groups access to a few
sites on the internet and then pretty much block everything else?


I?m able to restrict access to only a couple of sites and block everything
else without using ldap group authentication, was just hoping this can be
done with ldap group authentication.


Thanks,
Nando

Some HTTP agents mangle the "Connection:" header name as a way to
disable it rather than removing like they should.

Unless you have some custom patch on Squid doing this its not Squid. But
just being relayed because the mangled header name is interpreted as a
custom header.

Please read this page <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl>

Particularly the sections titled "Common Mistakes".

Well, no because you cannot authenticate a whole group. There is no such
thing as "ldap group authentication"

There is group *authorization*, with LDAP protocol used to fetch the
group details.

I suspect this is coming from the CONNECT requests Squid generates now
using the SNI value for the Host: header and authority instead of
raw-IP. That is supported by the absence of user-agent details in the
alert. With just raw-IP the host validation is not able to be done. Now
it is.

If so these new warnings are just exposing cases of SNI abuse. In other
words it is catching the TLS version of CVE-2009-0801.


I see that the Office 365 is hosted by Akamai. Which is one of the CDN
already known to do DNS tricks that lead to Host header problems.

Hey,

Are the users and proxy using different dns server?
Can you run dig from the proxy on this domain and dump the content to 
verify that the ip is indeed there?

I'm currently running with 3.5.8 again, so I'll have to find a quiet hour  
where I can upgrade and check this. I'll get back to you. Thanks!

Since they are using the same dns server there is no need to run some 
trials.
The only test you should in any case test is to see how long is the IP 
list from the DNS request for the domain name.

Subject: [squid-users] Can not pass Squid basic authentication
Message-ID: <tencent_556EFF81231F763C79D692CF@qq.com>

Hi All,


I have setup basic authentication for Squid, but I can not get passed from browser, just asked to inpu user/password time and time again.


I was stuck at, the command
/usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squid_passwd
dose not give any output. I think it means squid can not get the authentication info. But I have no idea what to do next.


I create my password by
htpasswd -d /etc/squid/squid_passwd dan


I also tried -m for htpasswd, it do generate different encrypted text, but still can not be recognized by /usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth.


My squid config is:


http_access deny !Safe_ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports


auth_param basic program /usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/squid_passwd
acl ncsa_users proxy_auth REQUIRED

http_access allow ncsa_users


Could anyone please tell what's wrong with this.
Any help will be highly appreciated!

Subject: [squid-users] Reverse proxy caching from SSL cache_peer depending
 on urlpath_regex
Message-ID: <1444344120580-4673627.post@n4.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am thinking about the idea of using Squid as a reverse proxy on https
(also on http), doing some caching and connecting to a SSL cache_peer and a
non SSL cache_peer depending on the address (e.g. login related addresses
would use the SSL cache_peer).

The goal is to make faster the browsing experience of the website by not
encrypting and decrypting on both the reverse proxy and the webserver
requests that do not need to be secured on the reverse proxy-webserver side.
Of course this could be done too on part of the server-client connections
but it would give a lot of problems such as web browsers alerts changing
from HTTPS to HTTP, similar alerts because of partial content on HTTPS, HTTP
would be worse for SEO too, safety risks sending login POST data from HTTP
to HTTPS, etc.

This approach makes me wonder the following questions and I would like to
confirm my thoughts:

- Can squid acting as a reverse proxy deal with caching with SSL similar
than it can do it without SSL? In any combination https_port accel and
cache_peer ssl; https_port accel and cache_peer (not ssl); http_port accel
and cache_peer ssl; http_port and cache_peer (not ssl)?

My understanding is that, yes, it can do it and that Squid get the content
from the cache_peer (encrypted if ssl), decrypt it if encrypted and store it
always not encrypted. Am I right?

- Can Squid use a SSL cache_peer just for specific addresses of the same
website/domain and a non SSL cache_peer for the rest of the addresses on the
same website/domain?

My understanding is that such a thing would be possible setting those two
different named cache_peers, one on port 443 with the ssl option and the
other on port 80; and then using acl urlpath_regex to choose what cache_peer
to use. Is that correct?

Cheers

Yes, and no. There is no complication about whether things have arrived
over a TCP connection vs TLS connection. They are just connections with
different URL schemes to a reverse-proxy. The client and server
connections in HTTP are independent.

Caching depends only on the message itself. What type of connection it
was received over is irrelevant.


FYI:

1) TLS (or SSL) is just a transport protocol to Squid, like TCP.

2) HTTPS is just HTTP transferred over a TLS connection.

All your questions come back to those details.

Can you upgrade your Squid to something more current?
The helper has been called basic_ncsa_auth since Squid-3.2

DES encoded passwords are highly insecure. Particularly if you are
trying to use more than 8 characters. Or any non-ASCII characters.

Current Squid NCSA helper rejects DES passwords greater than 8
characters since Squid-3.1.15.

You really need a newer Squid. MD5 support was added about Squid-2.6.

That looks fine. Assuming there are no http_access above it, nor other
access rules using authentication.

Message-ID: <2508801.1060771444370130283.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi,
I have a question about certificates wildcard.

I have a squid reverseproxy to provide many http servers in only one ip public.  The version of my squid is 3.1.19-1ubuntu2.
I have setup squid that work with ssl and I have setup a ssl server certificate but this certificate is only correct in one server.

I have read that is possible to install a wildcard (*.domain.es) that solves this problem, my question is if Squid have compatibility with this kind of certificate.

I need to pay so much money and I prefer ask you to know if is possible.

The installation is simple, is'nt it? I only need replace the ssl server certificate to wildcard certificate.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Yes. Use the wildcard certificate as the cert= parameter for your
https_port.

Message-ID: <CANukidJpOiJ9QnBgP3u4R1aMEgG=ZKD3PQMgxyHdzCvVYYcRDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using below setup:
Squid proxy 3.5.4.
CentOS 7.1

I am trying to analyze the most used websites by the users via Squid proxy.
I just require the first GET request for that particular browsed page page
& not the proceeding GETs of that same page.

Eg:
1) user enters *http://google.com <http://google.com>* in client (mozilla)
2) client gets page containing some other urls
3) client initiates multiple GETs for same requested page without users
knowledge

I myself tried a logic where I assumed if "Referer" header is present, then
its not the first GET but a proceeding one for same requested page.

I know i cant rely on "Referer" header to be always present as its not
mandatory. But
I want to know if my logic is correct? & also if there's any alternative
solution?

Your assumption is wrong. Referer header (when it exists) is tracking a
whole browsing session, not a particular website or page.

You would be better off taking the first use of any domain by a client,
then ignoring other requests for it until there is some long period
between two of them. The opposite of what session helpers do.

Then your Squid is a bit outdated. Please consider an upgrade.
The current Squid will at least complain about the manager and localhost
ACL definitions being built-in.

The problem you have is that you are allowing access to anyone who is
authenticated. End of story. No other permissions required. The
remainder of your access control config does nothing.

You ned to do this instead:

 http_access deny !ldap-auth

One you are using "deny !ldap-auth" for the auth check these group rules
will have a chance of doing something.


However, all of the above http_access lines should be placed below the
line which says "INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE"

Current best practice is to place these manager rules below the "CONNECT
!SSL_Ports" line.

Notice what the line above says. And how your authentication rules are
all up top well above the default rules that protect your system against
DoS and protocol abuse attacks.

Re-enable that "deny all" rule as the last http_access line.

Subject: [squid-users] analyze most used websites using squid
Message-ID: <CANukid+4vfenYcFeaZrZvXZfvD5RuKaNM9RxE50NQ9WEvAeicQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using below setup:
Squid proxy 3.5.4.
CentOS 7.1

I am trying to analyze the most used websites by the users via Squid proxy.
I just require the first GET request for that particular browsed page page
& not the proceeding GETs of that same page.

Eg:
1) user enters *http://google.com <http://google.com>* in client (mozilla)
2) client gets page containing some other urls
3) client initiates multiple GETs for same requested page without users
knowledge

I myself tried a logic where I assumed if "Referer" header is present, then
its not the first GET but a proceeding one for same requested page.

I know i cant rely on "Referer" header to be always present as its not
mandatory. But I want to know if my logic is correct? & also if there's any
alternative solution?

Subject: [squid-users] got http2?
Message-ID: <561AE35A.1090507@tlinx.org>





I was looking at some traffic differences between one of
my browsers going through squid and going direct (via masquerade).

The protocol usage in the 2nd case used 'http2' -- which started me
wondering what the heck that was...so googled around and
found it is an optimized http/1.1 mostly meant for packing
a website and streaming the whole thing as a byte-stream
to the client.


Interestingly, a few things are starting to support it:
nginx, chrome, MS(w/partial support), later firefox
versions... and several others.

In the http2-working (ietf) group, webpage loading
was about 50% faster (obviously depending on number
of items).  Supposedly it has to be 'encrypted' w/
TLS2, BUT I see nothing in spec that requires that.

Notably google was talking about http2 support on
their website, and the availability of businesses
with web-proxys to request that their clients not
use the bump to TLS2, but still allow the main
things that speed things up -- appending multiple
web items in 1 binary stream and using both
header and body compression.

I could see several ways/levels of squid supporting
this, but looking through my local mail archives,
I didn't see 'http2' mentioned once --either
on the users or the dev list and this complete
lack of its mention is leading me to think of the
that there is no ongoing work for it or future
plans at this point?

I think it is partly being supported through the current
squid by encapsulating a http2 session in a
http1.1 "tunnel" -- which raises some problems.

All the kinks aren't worked out yet, but
Proxy-Users scenarios are shown at:

https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Proxy-User-Stories

Are the impacts or implementation details
being thought about in squid?, since if it comes
down to it only being supported by encrypted
TUNNELS, its not only going to be hard to cache,
but also makes it a pain to implement http/browsing
controls on content -- since it would all
be encrypted and and compressed and impossible
to directly use in companies that need to filter
web-content as it comes in.

A bit concerned...
linda

(p.s. -- also sent to "-dev" group, but directed replies
to the user group -- feel free to reply as wanted, if
you feel it is needed, but didn't want to overload
dev list with something they may not be working on
yet and would just waste reading and 'discussion'
bandwidth)

Hi Amos,

Thanks for responding

*"You would be better off taking the first use of any domain by a client,*

*then ignoring other requests for it until there is some long period*
*between two of them. The opposite of what session helpers do."*

Could you please elaborate a little on the above logic.

My understanding, if not wrong, is to take domain/host of first client GET
request & don't consider the same if it matches with the subsequent GET
requests.

In this case there is possibility of multiple unique domains/hosts for
single page (Eg. other domain Ads, analytics etc)?

Wheezy kernel and system headers do not contain TPROXY support.

I suggest you upgrade to one of the newer Debian releases. Or at least
use the backports package. Those should contain all that you need to run
Squid on the outdated Debian system.

No it is HTTP version 2.0. As in the next-generation specification
release after 1.1.

Correct in that there is no such requirement. It is simply the Chrome
and Firefox developers are refusing to implement plain-text HTTP/2 for
port 80 usage, or support for proxies.

Almost all the other tools you will find supporting HTTP/2 can do so
happily over port 80. Some do not even support the TLS / HTTPS form of
HTTP/2.

And "50% faster" is false. The IETF HTTPbis WG only got a 20% latency
reduction. And take that with a grains of salt too, the measurements
were only taken for single browser->server hops. Since at the time no
tools supported proxies and no proxies existed for HTTP/2.
Still a great result, but not as big as 50%.

There is ongoing work to add it to Squid. But it has no sponsor paying
for it to happen anytime soon and been slowed the last few months as I
prepare for Squid-4 release.
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTP2>

HTTP/2 takes multiplexing to a whole new level above what HTTP/1.1
contains, which has been a design challenge. Squid-4 includes a lot of
the redesign work, but unfortunately I did not get the payload stream
and coders finished yet.

Yes.

And yet the only browser that will support sending HTTP/2 to a proxy is
MS IE. The more popular ones are simply refusing to implement half the
specification. It does not bode well for interoperability.

Those problems are not HTTP/2 related. As you noticed there is no TLS
requirement in the specification. They are side effects of the "TLS
everywhere" campaign that those same browser vendors have taken up.

Squid can MITM the TLS tunnels. When it does so it strips away the
tokens negotiating SPDY, HTTP/2 and QUIC to make the communication be
HTTP/1.1 over the proxy.

Subject: [squid-users] [squid-announce] Squid 3.5.10 is available
Message-ID: <560E3FF7.5090208@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid HTTP Proxy team is very pleased to announce the availability
of the Squid-3.5.10 release!


This release is a bug fix release resolving issues found in the prior
Squid releases.


The major changes to be aware of:


* Regression Bug 4326: base64 binary encoder rejects data beginning
  with nil byte

This regression since 3.3 introduced by hardening of the base-64 encoder
causes unnecessary CPU consumtion during Digest authenticatio on
big-endian systems. Thanks to Pavel ?imerda for identifying the problem
and providing the fix.


* Bug 4323: Netfilter broken cross-includes with Linux 4.2

Due to a problem with Netfilter (libc) header includes Squid and other
software using Netfilter will not build on Linux 4.2. The kernel
developers have provided a hack to allow software to build, but it
requires some changes on our part to make use of it. Those changes are
included in this Squid release.


* Bug 4303: PeerConnector.cc:743 "!callback" assertion.

This problem occurs when slow-group ACLs are used in ssl_bump and no
bumping action is selected (the default action is being performed).
Squid now makes smarter choice of default ssl_bump action to perform
when no explicit ACL match is provided.

Note: The bug number recorded in bzr, changelog and patch header is
wrong. The correct number is 4303.


* Bug 4330: Do not use SSL_METHOD::put_cipher_by_char

Recent changes to this OpenSSL and LibreSSL library API behaviour mean
that Squids particular use of it could result in crashes, or incorrect
rejection of TLS/SSL connections.


* Memory management optimizations

This release includes removal of a custom allocator pool size for
StoreEntry objects. Knowledge of the actual benefits from that supposed
optimization have been lost in time, and it's not possible to accurately
measure its actual impact in all load scenarios; this change is
therefore considered a potential performance regression in some load
scenarios.

Initial testing of this change show an overall reduction in Squid memory
needs for general usage. So we belive this is a worthwhile change until
proven otherwise.


* Copyright Updates

As part of the Squid Software Foundation project to cleanup the Squid
copyright situation it was found that the basic_sspi_auth,
ntlm_smb_lm_auth, and ntlm_fake_auth helpers were GPL 2.0-only licensed.
This is not fully compatible with the GPLv2+ terms Squid bundles are
officially being distributed under, which is intended to allow
downstream GPLv3 or later relicensing.

The main authors and copyright holders of those helpers have graciously
agreed to relicense them as GPLv2+ for compatibility with the Squid
collective license.

The libltdl tools bundled with Squid has also undergone a relicense to
LGLv2.1+ in the version we import.



 All users of Squid are encouraged to upgrade to this release as soon as
possible.


 See the ChangeLog for the full list of changes in this and earlier
 releases.

Please refer to the release notes at
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/RELEASENOTES.html
when you are ready to make the switch to Squid-3.5

Upgrade tip:
  "squid -k parse" is starting to display even more
   useful hints about squid.conf changes.

This new release can be downloaded from our HTTP or FTP servers

Thanks for mentioning it here, I didn't even know about it, like you. And 
of course you study it really well before commenting, mostly unlike me :p.

I have this feeling that I like SPDY better than HTTP2? Anyone agree?

HTTP2 only defines the transit/connection, right? The compression, 
multiplexing. It seems a bit incredulous to call it a new HTTP version.

It also seems to be sponsoring corporate interests. I have this tight 
feeling that it's mostly to do with a few top-10 websites like Facebook 
and Twitter and Google and so on.

The lean web is long past.

Anyone ever notice how CDNs are usually the things preventing loading of a 
page? It is usually a remote source that is hanging a page load. I mean 
external to the website itself.

Facebook itself requires at least 300-500K per page and that is just the 
frame that is sent first. After that it starts pipelining the rest of the 
"real" content.

They are already compressing all of their javascript to use 
shortest-possible names (identifiers) and it is still this big.

Me still wonders why "paging" was not a good model. I avoid webshops that 
use a continuous-load page, and thankfully there are not many.

Just the fact that the browser developers are refusing certain things, 
makes it rather clear they are ... not sure how to frame or phrase it. 
Let's just call it "having an agenda".

I remember how... well. You know, Apache and the no-tracking thing by 
Microsoft as a default, and Apache was pushed by "the industry" to ignore 
Microsoft's flag/request. The guy basically said that he was fed up with 
the bullying and just complied.

I believe the browser vendors are basically "owned" by a group centering 
around Facebook and Google. Just an impression based on their behaviours. 
The way they are pushing invalidation of older certificates in order to 
maintain security. It's not reasonable, and whenever something is not 
reasonable, something else is not being said.

Sounds a bit paranoid perhaps. Perhaps I find it more important than it 
really is.

Regards, B.

Enough to verify what I am saying, usually, but I have expert

fundamentals that help me build understanding of new things,
but now days, teaching fundamentals is passe, because

	You might want to read just 2 pages:

On the 2nd you would see:
  After a call for proposals and a selection process, SPDY/2 was chosen as the 
  basis for HTTP/2. ...  In February 2015, Google announced its plans to remove
  support for SPDY in favor of HTTP/2.

  On second page mentioned above:

   What are the key differences to HTTP/1.x?
   At a high level, HTTP/2:

     o  is binary, instead of textual
     o  is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
     o  can therefore use one connection for parallelism
     o  uses header compression to reduce overhead
     o  allows servers to ?push? responses proactively into client caches

My biggest annoyance is the SSL/TLS everywhere... because I want to see
what is coming from where and possibly be able to block it -- which is 
*EXACTLY* why web-content owners/presenters are wanting it -- to remove
avenues of control and introspection into their processes.

Try it without the colon. You only need a colon to separate the
ip/hostname and port values.

Doesn't matter. All that matters is where you want to go and what you  
need for that.

I read them before saying that ;-). Just a hunch.

Like, usually I know very little about the things I am forming an  
opinion about. I have only little time and energy. So I need to devise  
my path based on instinct and intuition.

Yes yes, I read it. Thank you *honey*.

They are using it as a mechanism to get more control away from users.  
Encryption doesn't have that much benefit and particularly the man in  
the middle thing is vastly exaggerated. The bible mentioned somewhere  
that there would be a sign or number and only those with the sign or  
number would be allowed to do business.

Of course this is simply locking down of control so everyone complies  
with your wishes. This is why the positions of the browser makers are  
so un-negotiable. It's the same thing as that Windows 10 supposedly  
scanning for pirated software and constantly complaining about  
unsigned software (even .mp4s)!!. I get this freaking unsigned warning  
at least 10 times a day. Haven't figured out how to turn it off yet.  
You should see what goes on in a courtroom. How people who are accused  
are not given the light of day to say anything.

People are very afraid. They are afraid of what is to come, and they  
are also afraid of those who would change it.

And they are trying to protect themselves and their families by  
destroying anything that could oppose them. And what they oppose,  
grows stronger, and they are creating a monster.

Please continue to use that later version. In absence of any other
useful information about yoru Squid or what it supposed to be doing the
below response assumes you are using 3.5.8.

Please do supply a description of how your Squid is _supposed_ to be
used. And any access policies you are expecting to be enforced by the proxy.

This rule allows URLs within the *.dailymotion.com domains to be cached.
The implicit followup prevents any others from being stored.

To let everything be cached properly, just remove the above "cache
allow" rule.

Allowing anyone who can access the proxy to view the proxy management
reports and controls.

> http_access allow all

"allow all" does not deny anything. You have an "open proxy".

What do you think this is doing?

You disabled memory pools. No need to set a limit for it.

> cache_mem 5 GB
> #maximum_object_size_in_memory 64 KB
> maximum_object_size_in_memory 2048 KB

Meaning you can store 2 of the big objects in memory. The rest has to be
on disk.

This can cause major latency problems when Squid has to export up to 1
million small (1KB+) objects out of memory for one of these big objects.

Then when the big object expires it happens all over again, as up to 1
million small objects get loaded back from back from disk or network.


> minimum_object_size 1 KB 
> maximum_object_size 3 GB

This is a default. You can remove the cache_store_log line entirely.

> access_log daemon:/var/log/squid3/access.log !CONNECT

You have an open proxy. CONNECT is usually the method used to send abuse
through open proxies. Ignoring it all is a bad idea.

> cache_log /var/log/squid3/cache.log

This should be a default. You can remove the cache_log line entirely.

These options do nothing useful, and are quite harmful:
 ignore-private ignore-auth ignore-must-revalidate


Since you are running a reverse proxy, claiming to be the CDN operator
for the domain dailmotion.com and others you should also stop screwing
your clients over with "override-expire override-lastmod ignore-reload
ignore-no-store" and get their origin servers fixed instead.

"xcache" is not a publicly resolvable domain name. The visible_hostname
should be the CDN hostname used to access your proxy. It *will* be
displayed to visitors.

Please also read the unique_hostname documentation. It is rarely
necessary to use that directive. If you dont need it, remove it.


> dns_nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 4.2.2.4

So, you are running a CDN to mirror Google hosted websites?


> shutdown_lifetime 10 second

Many of the lines below are default settings for Squid-3.5. You should
check them and remove the ones that are only setting a default value.

Hi,

Thanks for responding

*"You would be better off taking the first use of any domain by a client,*

*then ignoring other requests for it until there is some long period*
*between two of them. The opposite of what session helpers do."*

Could you please elaborate a little on the above logic.

My understanding, if not wrong, is to take domain/host of first client GET
request & don't consider the same if it matches with the subsequent GET
requests.

In this case there is possibility of multiple unique domains/hosts for
single page (Eg. other domain Ads, analytics etc)?

That is about as clear as I can explain it sorry. Look at what the
session helpers do to determine whether two requests are part of the
same session or not.

You need to start with that *then* figure out how to split each sequence
of requests now grouped into "session" down into whatever grouping you
define "page" to be.

Yes. There is simply no concept of "page" in HTTP.

It is a hard problem to even figure out with any accuracy what requests
are coming from the same client.

Hey Ambadas,

I was wondering if you want it to be something like a "live feed" or 
just for logs analyzing?

Subject: [squid-users] SQUID: cache_dir filling up and squid imploding
Message-ID: <1444745105.2915.7.camel@eurotux.com>


Hi all,

We have a squid running for quite a few years and with the increase of
traffic we noticed a bit of I/O hammering on the squid server (local
disks).

For some testing, I've made a small 1.2GB tmpfs and pointed cache_dir
to it so that our cache would be in the 'ramdrive'.

This did help a lot with I/O, but squid eventually once in a while
implodes when it fills 1.2GB of the ramdrive (cache_dir is configured
for 1G, leaving 200MB free).

This is on a CentOS based system:

[####EDIT#### squid]# rpm -qi squid
Name        : squid                        Relocations: (not
relocatable)

Anyone can help? Imagine I want to keep working on a ramdrive with

doesnt fill the space?

Any options I should look over again which might help me diagnose if it
happens again?

The problem here isn't the tmpfs, but instead Squid going 20% over the
max size defined in cache_dir, or am I missing something?

Have you read:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/ConfiguringSquid
"What cache_dir size should I use?"

20% extra may be more than you were expecting, but it's not ridiculous.

Hi Antony,

I had actually seen that document and it's "10%". That's why I've left
20% also taking in mind the space reserved for 'root'.

I suppose we have to increase it and go on trial/error until we find a
safe margin?

Another option is to upgrade and use Rock store that does not force you
to play those guessing games -- the maximum size used for Rock store is
constant and should match your Squid configuration.

I have implemented TPROXY to replace my NAT setup on a CentOS 7 Squid
3.3 box. Currently the IPv4 connectivity is working great, the IPv6
connectivity is broken when going through TPROXY. All IPv6 connections
timeout and from tests it appears there is a broken IPv6 setup. Using
test-ipv6.com I get a broken/misconfiguration warning. IPv6
connections handled by the standard 3128 setup work OK, direct IPv6
connections outside of the proxy are also OK, TPROXY IPv6 is not
working properly.

I have looked at several TPROXY resources and cannot see where I have
gone wrong or what might be causing the issue. I am using my DD-WRT
routing with policy routing to pass the traffic to the Squid box which
then uses further policy routing to push the traffic to the TPROXY
binding on port 3129.

DD-WRT firewall/routing rules:

PROXY_IPV6="2001:470:xxxx:xx::x"
CLIENTIFACE="br0"
FWMARK=3

ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i $CLIENTIFACE -s $PROXY_IPV6 -p tcp
--dport 80 -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i $CLIENTIFACE -p tcp --dport 80 -j
MARK --set-mark $FWMARK
ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m mark --mark $FWMARK -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -t filter -A FORWARD -i $CLIENTIFACE -o $CLIENTIFACE -p tcp
--dport 80 -j ACCEPT

ip -f inet6 rule add fwmark $FWMARK table 2
ip -f inet6 route add default via $PROXY_IPV6 dev $CLIENTIFACE table 2


Squid box firewall and routing rules:

ip -f inet6 rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
ip -f inet6 route add local default dev eno1 table 100

ip6tables -t mangle -F
ip6tables -t mangle -X
ip6tables -t mangle -N DIVERT

ip6tables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j MARK --set-mark 1
ip6tables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m socket -j DIVERT
ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j TPROXY
--tproxy-mark 0x1/0x1 --on-port 3129


The following sysctl values are set:

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
net.ipv4.conf.eno1.rp_filter = 0

I have defined specific IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the Squid traffic
to go over, I had to exclude these with PREROUTING RULES as this broke
connectivity on LAN clients which use the standard http_port setup of
3128. IPv6 connectivity for these clients is OK.

iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.x.x -j
ACCEPT
ip6tables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -s
2001:470:xxxx:xx::x -j ACCEPT


I don't know if I need additional values for any ipv6 config value.
Nothing is mentioned in the TPROXY Squid wiki article.


Any ideas on what I could be missing?

Thanks,

James

Message-ID: <5FE0959288C73D448BB44CB7E9CC320F5828ACA2B1@CPUMAIL2.cpu.qc.ca>

Hi,

I searched on the doc and on the web, I cant find what I want.
The primary site is http://ezproxyxxxxx.reseaubiblio.ca.
After the user is authentificated, he cans access many ressources / other sites.

In the access.log, I got an TCP_DENIED
TCP_DENIED/403 4524 GET http://www.worldbookonline.com.ezproxyxxxxx.reseaubiblio.ca/decouverte/home

I would like allow all subdomain like http://www.worldbookonline.com.ezproxyxxxxx.reseaubiblio.ca<http://www.worldbookonline.com.ezproxyxxxxx.reseaubiblio.ca%20>.
How can I do that ?

cache_peer ezproxyxxxxx.reseaubiblio.ca parent 80 0 no-query originserver name=ezproxycqlm
acl ezproxycqlmacl dstdomain ezproxycqlm.reseaubiblio.ca
http_access allow www80 ezproxycqlmacl
cache_peer_access ezproxycqlm allow www80 ezproxycqlmacl
cache_peer_access ezproxycqlm deny all

Thanks.

Cheers,

S?bastien

Subject: [squid-users] Delay pool with large negative numbers
Message-ID: <CAEpx-0Vu72ZnBHy9EW=Qwbf6vgd4k4vbEW3Lf39iLupQkGxjag@mail.gmail.com>

I have configured delay pools for a client that delays access to a few
sites, including youtube and facebook.
It seems to work for some clients, and has significantly reduced link
congestion. However, some clients seem to be unaffected by the delay pools.

The output to squidclient mgr:delay is as follows:

Sending HTTP request ... done.

Memory Used: 1496 bytes


I have searched for answers and some do mention that sometimes the current
bytes in the pool shoudl be negative, but a low negative like -1 or -6. To
me it seems that the delay pools are beeing ignored...

Thanks for any help.

Subject: [squid-users] Safari 9 vs. SSL Bump
Message-ID: <6D53613A-50A8-4A3D-8C0B-F74708B23676@getbusi.com>

Throwing this out to the list in case anyone else might be trying to get SSL Bump to work with the latest version of Safari.

Every other browser on OS X (and iOS) is happy with bumping for pretty much all HTTPS sites, so long as the proxy?s CA is trusted. 

However Safari throws generic ?secure connection couldn?t be established? errors for many popular HTTPS sites in including:
- wikipedia.org
- mail.google.com
- twitter.com
- github.com

But quite a number of others work, such as youtube.com.

This error gets logged to the system whenever it occurs:
com.apple.WebKit.Networking: NSURLSession/NSURLConnection HTTP load failed (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9802)

Apparently this is related to Apple?s new ?App Transport Security? protections, in particular, the fact that ?the server doesn?t support forward secrecy?. Even though it doesn?t seem to be affecting mobile Safari on iOS 9 at all.

It?s also notable that Safari seems perfectly happy with legacy server-first SSL bumping. 

I?m using Squid 3.5.10 and this is my current config: https://gist.github.com/djch/9b883580c6ee84f31cd1

Anyone have any idea what I can try?

Hi Amos,
I have tested squid 3.5.10 in linux kernel 3.16 compiled for debian wheezy.
But still I am seeing same kind of errors.
What could be the issue? Is there anything else we need to change?

*Linux version *
uname -r
3.16.7-ckt11-ram.custom-1.4


*Squid version*
/usr/sbin/squid -v
Squid Cache: Version 3.5.10

Regards,

He did it was hidden in the middle.

Sebastien:

Place a '.' as the prefix on the dstdomain.
Like this:
  acl example dstdomain .example.com

You can try bump at step3 (roughly equivalent to server-first) instead
of step2 (aka client-first).

Do you also have libcap2 ? It needs to be present at both build and run
time.

Other than than all I'm aware of is a mystery issue (probably kernel
related) in Debian Squeeze and Wheezy that nobody ever got figured out,
which disappeared in Jesse.

Sounds like it might be a side effect of
<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522>

Or it could be the fact that delay pools are still 32-bit functionality.

I thought that fixed it for a second ? 

But in reality ssl_bump peek step1 & ssl_bump bump step3 is actually splicing everything, it seems.

Any other advice? :-)

This sounds like <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3553>
which was fixed in Squid-3.5.8

Please try an upgraded package. Eliezer provides more up to date

Could this imply be a pinning issue? ie does Safari track the CAs used
by those sites - thus causing the problem you see? Certainly matches the
symptoms

Double-check the meaning of 0 in those rules. The rp_filter value
meanings changed just prior to 3.x kernels, and no longer do what most
online tutorials say.

Pause.

How is traffic to --dport 3128 matching "-p tcp -m tcp --dport 80" ?

It seems to me that would be part of yoru problem. Unless you mean that
these rules had to go on the router. In which case, yes you do need to
prevent Squid outbound traffic being looped back to it a second time.

Given the likelihood of so called "privacy addressing" in IPv6 you may
need to make the v6 bypasses use /64 subnets instead of single IP's

When debugging make sure "via on" directive exists in squid.conf. That
will highlight looping errors that you may have from misconfiguration
TPROXY.


Also, make sure that ICMP and path-MTU etc are working. Particularly
from the Squid machine to the Internet.

If you haven't already been through the list and double/triple-checked,
the troubleshooting section of
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Tproxy4> may have the answer.

 ?\_(?)_/?

All I really have to go on is those errors com.apple.WebKit.Networking is logging which apparently points to a specific thing it?s missing called ?forward transport security?. Only the peek at step1 seems to make it as far as any of squid?s logs.

No other browsers affected that I can find, not even mobile Safari. The sites that do and don?t fail seems random too.

Fine: instagram.com, getpocket.com, youtube.com

Not fine: httpbin.org, news.ycombinator.com, basecamp.com, wikipedia.org, dribbble.com, icloud.com, vimeo.com, reddit.com

I meant to say ?forward secrecy?, which appears to be a list of specific ciphers:
https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/index.html

Anyone know how to translate that list of ciphers to use in sslproxy_cipher in squid.conf?

ECDHE means they are all Elliptic Curves. Which are only supported by
Squid-4.

Hi Eliezer,

Its mostly like a live feed.

I am writing these sites+(a client tracking parameter) to a flat file via
squid, from where another process reads it & does further processing (eg.
analyze top sites used by any particular client).

And that is why i was working on getting just the urls entered by clients.

You now got my attention!
Depends on what you want you might be able to use external logging 
helper for that.
I am unsure if it is possible to use two access log directives in the 
configuration and Amos or others can answer that.
It is pretty simple to implement since the input data will flow like any 
access log lines but to a program.
Then you can update some DB live.
There is an option to even use the same log daemon for both logging and 
http interface for the statistics but I will not go this way now.
...
I have tested and it seems possible to use two access_log directives.
I am unsure how to implement the idea of both access.log and external 
logger combined.
But there is sure the option of:
"access_log tcp://host:port"
Which if you will write a TCP service will make your life easy.
I am unfamiliar with the logging protocol but it seems like the wiki can 
help with that.

*I am willing to write an example tcp log daemon for the squid in 
golang\ruby\python for the squid project if one is not present in these 
languages.*

Eliezer

* Testing 3.5.10 RPMs is in progress.

Yes it is possible to use two multiple access_log directives. But not
multiple logfile_daemon directives.

OK then tcp it is.
An example line by line daemon handler which can be extended to be 
customized with ip+port selection and many other features.
http://paste.ngtech.co.il/psgfb2lci

It can be used with a DB or to just store the statistics internally.
It is very simple due to the one direction and line by line flow.
I will later add the log msg\line parsing which will be compatible with 
"squid" log format.
 From there it's all a piece of cake.
And this is actually a very nice idea to have a nice feed of all sort of 
things.

Subject: [squid-users] debug skype ssl_bump numeric ips to be spliced
Message-ID: <20151014140052.14e3eff8@efreet.kappastar.com>

Hi,

I read this interesting thread:
http://squid-web-proxy-cache.1019090.n4.nabble.com/Skype-SSL-is-incompatible-with-OpenSSL-td4665803.html

And from what I read, I'd assume those entries in cache.log ...

2015/10/14 13:44:51 kid1| Error negotiating SSL on FD 144: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed (1/-1/0)

... are caused by skype clients, or other clients that use port 443 for
non-ssl traffic.

My ssl_bump setup is as follows:

acl splice_ips dst "/usr/local/etc/squid/splice_ips"
acl step1 at_step SslBump1
ssl_bump peek step1
ssl_bump splice splice_ips
ssl_bump bump all

Is there a way to increase verbosity of cache.log in a way that I get
more information about this? I guess I am mostly interested in remote
IP addresses so I can add them to splice_ips ACL.

Thank you in advance,

This may not be related to your specific problem, but I want to clarify
the above.

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump bump step3

A recent Squid mis-configured using the above sketch should indeed
splice everything. When Squid reaches bumping step2, no ssl_bump rule
matches, so Squid uses the previous step rule to decide what to do.
Since peeking implies splicing, Squid splices at step2 and never gets to
step3.

It is possible that, in his "bump at step3" recommendation below, Amos
was talking about this kind of configuration:

  ssl_bump stare all
  ssl_bump bump all

Bugs notwithstanding, the above results in bumping at step3.

Alex.

My personal recommendation would be to use a search engine such as Google to 
look for information about "Squid" and "redirect" in the hopes of finding that 
someone has created a helpful and thorough piece of documentation such as 
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Redirectors

If, however, you have already completed this step, and found that it didn't 
help, then by all means tell us what you tried and what went wrong (with log 
reports where relevant).


Regards,


Antony.

Subject: [squid-users] ssl_crtd initialization SSL db error
Message-ID: <561EC06D.8080209@fastmail.fm>

Hi all,

I'm following the instructions on this page 
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/SslBumpExplicit
to set up Squid as an end-point for HTTPS communications, and am hitting 
an error when attempting to create and initialize an SSL certificates 
cache directory.

Having taken care to ensure that my chosen directory exists 
(/usr/local/var/cache/squid/ssl_db) and has the same ownership as the 
user which I'm using to execute ssl_crtd, I execute the following 
command from within squid's libexec directory:

./ssl_crtd -c -s /usr/local/var/cache/squid/ssl_db

This gives the following output:

Initialization SSL db...
./ssl_crtd: Cannot create /usr/local/var/cache/squid/ssl_db


All the mailing list searching I've done suggests that this is a 
permissions issue, but the folder is owned by me, has permissions 755, 
and I'm running ssl_crtd.

For what it's worth, I'm running v3.5.7 on OS X (via Homebrew) which was 
built with --enable-ssl --enable-ssl-crtd --disable-eui

Can anyone suggest what my issue might be? Does ssl_crtd internally run 
as an alternate user? I don't appear to have any user accounts dedicated 
to Squid.


All suggestions welcome,

Ian

Hey,

Antony:
It depends. and also squid has the capability to redirect traffic 
without Redirectors and the recommendation is still staying that if you 
can use some variation of squid settings to result a redirection such as 
deny_info use it instead of an external helper.

Sebastian:
It is very much depends on if the services are being served from the 
same squid instance or that one domain is on another server while the 
other is served by a squid(as a reverse proxy).
Once you answer the above question there is a chance you will get an answer.

Thanks for clarifying, Alex. We tried this config but Safari still doesn?t like it, sadly.

I feel like if server-first is working there must be *some* combination of peek/stare/bump that?ll work too?it can?t be that ?forward secrecy? cipher stuff. 

I really don?t want our customers to have to use server-first if they decide to employ bumping, so if any of you smart people have any other suggestions, please send them through.

Thanks

While that feeling is natural, you should resist it. Newer SslBump
actions do not simply dissect the old ones into smaller steps. The old
actions (e.g., server-first) do not do some of the things that the new
actions do (e.g., peek extracts and sends SNI but server-first does
not). Doing more sometimes leads to more problems, especially in
experiment-driven features such as SslBump. Besides different cipher
negotiation patterns, you may be hitting a bug that server-first code
path lacks, for example.

I second Amos' implied suggestion to try the latest Squid 4.0 as the
next step. This does not mean you have to _deploy_ Squid 4.0:

* If Squid 4.0 does not work in your tests, we will not need to suspect
newer ciphers and may get more information from newer logs. We will also
be slightly more motivated to fix or improve something.

* If Squid 4.0 works, we will know more about your problem and may
suggest some other solutions if you have to run an older Squid.

In either case, do collect "debug_options ALL,9" cache logs for an
isolated test case.


Please note that I am not volunteering to examine your logs, and there
is no guarantee that this next step will lead to a solution, but it is
relatively easy to make that step.


HTH,

Alex.

... or they are servers using invalid certificates

.. or they are servers using TLS extensions your library does not
understand how to deal with,

... or they are servers with revoked certificates

... or they are servers using a TSL certificate version your library has
been told not to accept

All those lines imply is a certificate verify problem inside the SSL
library.

Also note that the FD numbers are different, meaning each line is a
completely different TCP connection. The only thing they have in common
is that they are errors.

You could use "debug_options 17,3". It produces a line that may be
prefixed "FwdState::connectDone" on successful server TCP connection
setup just prior to TLS initiation.

Or you could try out Squid-4. Which has automatic bypass for non-HTTPS
traffic and will resolve the confusion over whether it was actually
non-HTTPS or just a broken certificate.


Your logic is based on a flawed assumption though. Squid is a proxy.
Which means its very purpose is to select the best server from a whole
set to provide an answer for the bumped request.

Failure to perform TLS to connect to one server for a domain does not
means all IPs for that domain are bad. Squid will simply try other
alternative IPs or servers until one succeeds or there are no more
usable destinations.

--enable-ssl does not exist in Squid-3.5. Use --with-openssl instead.

Please also try to get the very latest 3.5 release when dealing with
ssl-bump, the features are quite volatile still.

Currently that is 3.5.10 for stable production use or 4.0.1 (beta) if it
works for your needs.

That does not matter until after the DB has been created. In order to
make sure the DB is useable by the Squid initiated helpers.

You should be able to run the above creation command with any account
having ownership of the directory - but not use the resulting DB with Squid.


Sadly that helper has quiet bad debugging output still. So you won't get
much better output from newer Squid releases, just better behaviour.


The following is how to determin your squid low-privilege account name:

* Run "squid -k parse 2>&1 | grep cache_effective_user" to see if
squid.conf has been configured to override the built-in account with
something specific to your install,

* if nothing is found; Run "squid -v" to see if the --with-default-user
build option has been set to any particular account name,

* Otherwise; the default is account "nobody".

Would it be possible to put the ip:port in those error messages? Would
certainly help answer those questions...

You can remove the always_direct line. It was a temporary hack for bugs
in squid-3.1. It does nothing useful in your config.

Configuring peeking to happen *after* splicing does not make any sense.
The "peek whitelist_ssl" will never happen.

"fitered http"? you don't have anything configured that could even
remotely be called that.

At a guess I believe you are expecting ssl-bump operations to happen on
the port 3128 or 3130 traffics CONNECT requests. But you have not
configured it to be done on those ports.

How certain are you that is the config file being used?
The access.log says things are explicitly being denied, which that
config says are allowed.

Try running squid -k parse, and see if there are any ERROR or FATAL
messages displayed.

Also check that the output lines saying "Processing:" contain the config
file lines you are expecting to be used.

Two problems;

#0 it is not an error. Errors get logged with the word "error" or
"ERROR" or "FATAL".


#1 your disk I/O queue was not big enough for the traffic being
processed through it. Squid is increasing the queue size automatically,
and warning you about the change. That is all.
 On older Squid you can expect a few (maybe a few dozen) on startup, and
on the first time it goes through a traffic peak. queue growth is
exponential. It is only a problem if it continues for a long time.


#2 your Squid version is outdated. Current Squid version is 3.5.10 and
includes a number of bug fixes relating to disk I/O issues. Any one of
those could be contributing to the "slow".

If I want to do a redirection from http to http, do I need to use a url_rewrite_program or can I use the deny_info 302:.... ?

Hey,

Antony:
It depends. and also squid has the capability to redirect traffic without Redirectors and the recommendation is still staying that if you can use some variation of squid settings to result a redirection such as deny_info use it instead of an external helper.

Sebastian:
It is very much depends on if the services are being served from the same squid instance or that one domain is on another server while the other is served by a squid(as a reverse proxy).
Once you answer the above question there is a chance you will get an answer.

Just a data point, but I've just got up Safari on Yosemite connecting
through squid-3.5.10 to https://wikipedia.org/ with full bump-ing with
no problems.

Same with twitter.com and github.com. Click on the padlock shows the
server cert chaining to my squidCA cert (which is trusted of course)

ie this can't have anything to do with Elliptic Curves or pinning

I seem to recall this happening on 10.10 as well, but it could be an El Capitan thing. Do you mind reminding me of your squid config Jason?

Thanks!

With my config I trying to "aggressively" figure out if the transaction
is safely going to be bump-able. I'm more willing to throw away (ie
splice) things I'm unsure about than risk a client seeing an error. But
for the websites you see problems with, I see nice clean bump-ing


http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/etc/squid/squidCA.cert 
generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=256MB options=ALL
acl DiscoverSNIHost at_step SslBump1
ssl_bump peek DiscoverSNIHost
#do we have a SNI? If not, it's not TLS
acl SNIpresent ssl::server_name_regex .*

#this file contains https sites that we do not intercept - such as banks
(because we want the data transfers to remain private)
#and accounts.google.com (because Chrome uses cert pinning for that domain)
# in general you will need to add all sites that involve cert pinning
acl NoSSLIntercept ssl::server_name_regex -i
"/etc/squid/acl-NoSSLIntercept.txt"

#this external_acl process will sanity-check HTTPS transactions that
haven't being spliced yet
#to ensure only the correct ones end up being bumped

Thanks!

So ignoring the ?bumpable? helper check, it?s effectively peeking at step1 and then bumping it like my config?s doing.

I wonder what else could be differentiating it. Is your proxy CA just installed in the Login keychain?

Nope - did it "properly" at the OS level. Get a PEM version of your
squidCA pubkey and as root do

security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -p ssl -p smime -p IPSec -p
eap -p basic /path/squidCA.pem > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
certtool i "/path/squidCA.pem"   k=/System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors
> /dev/null 2>&1 || true

The "ipsec/smime" stuff is actually not needed - but I don't care ;-) I
went for the carpet bombing approach for the Mac (which I don't know well)

Great, thanks. Don?t know why I didn?t think of it before but I?ll try elevating it from Login -> System keychain and see what happens.

Deny_info should work fine.

Ports 1025-65535 are all open in Safe_ports by default. That should not
be needed.

401 is the upstream origin server requiring authentication credentials
from the client.

Port 10000 is not involved with that transaction, and the Squid parts of
the transaction are working perfectly as far as that line is showing.

So after all that, it was my choice of keychain that was the problem. Every HTTPS site works with the CA cert in the System keychain as opposed to login.

I?ll put that down to OS X probably using some system-level processes to do some of Safari?s work, or something.

Thanks Alex, Amos, and Jason for your help on this.

Just as a side note:
webmin mainly being used over https ie CONNECT from squid point of view.
So the addition should be to the SSL_ports acl and not the Safe_ports acl.

Hi everyone,

I've just discovered that making requests to our reverse proxy using a
Vodafone umts connection does not work.
I get a bad request, and the problem is that in the http header the GET
line does not include the full path but just the relative one. The "Host:"
parameter in the header is ok and it contains the host address.
If I make the request using different internet mobile providers I have no
problems, so it seems it's something with Vodafone that strips the url!

In the RFC 2616 (chapter 5.1.2) they say:
"The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a
proxy. "

So, is there a way with Squid 3.4 (or newer versions) to solve or
workaround this problem?

Thank you.

Gianluca

RFC 2616 is obsolete. HTTP is now governed by RFC 7230-7235.

You said this was a reverse-proxy. The rules for reverse-proxy are the
same as the rules for origin servers, not the rules for proxies.
That includes the relevance of RFC 7230 section 5.3.1.

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3>

So either you *dont* have a reverse-proxy, or the problem is something
other than what you think.

Hi Amos,

Thank you for the support.
This is my squid.conf
http://pastebin.com/hNmnck27

We use squid as external access to hosts services (port 80) that are in a
vpn, so this should be the classical use of a reverse proxy.

What do you think?
Thank you.

I was right. You dont have a reverse-proxy. You have a explicit/forward
proxy that happens to be listening on port 80.

To make it a reverse-proxy you need to set the mode flag on http_port to
"accel".

See the documentation:
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port/>
 <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Reverse/VirtualHosting>

That depends on whether the Squid you are using has HTTPS decryption
capabilities (SSL-Bump) built.

Possibly. But their methods will not be the same as it was in the past.
YT content should be prefectly cacheable. But its devs have decided to
fight against letting HTTP working properly for the YT site.

"Squid" is a proxy for general Internet usage. Hard-coding into it
logics to cache one specific website, which may change at any time and
break that code, it is not appropriate.

There are still people offering Squid extensions that do YT caching.
They have kind of gone underground again once it became clear that every
time anyone documented in public how to cache the videos YT developers
would suddenly change how the system worked and break that method of
caching.

FYI: SquidVideosBooster is one product that offers video caching
extensions to Squid if you are looking for one. You will need to combine
it with ssl-bump usage.

Ok thanks.

Hi,

When I try to access www.domain.qc.ca<http://www.domain.qc.ca> it works perfectly BUT when I try domain.domain.qc.ca, it fails.

1445003869.430      4 65.94.187.169 TCP_MISS/200 9269 GET http://www.domain.qc.ca/ - FIRSTUP_PARENT/xx.xx.xx.xx text/html

My config is

http_port xxx.xx.xx.xx:80 accel defaultsite=domainweb1 name=incoming80
acl www80 myportname incoming80
cache_peer www.domain.qc.ca parent 80 0 no-query originserver name=domainwebwww
acl domainwebacl dstdomain www. domain.qc.ca
http_access allow www80 domainwebacl
cache_peer_access domainwebwww allow www80 domainwebacl
cache_peer_access domainwebwww deny all

Anyone have an idea ?
Is it a web server side issue or a Squid issue ?

Thanks you very much!

Have you looked in the web server logs?
What happens when Squid is not used?

Of course. It will make it behave the way you apparently need it to.

Thanks amos ,
What about if it was for ISP and the ssl pump is impossible since it will break the privacy and will  need user end user agreement to pass the websites  .


Im asking regarding facebook since its 100 % https
And asking about youtube videos  since its 100 % https

I don?t know how companies like cachevideis & cachemara still offer videos caching so far  ??!!!!

That depends on whether the Squid you are using has HTTPS decryption
capabilities (SSL-Bump) built.

Possibly. But their methods will not be the same as it was in the past.
YT content should be prefectly cacheable. But its devs have decided to
fight against letting HTTP working properly for the YT site.

"Squid" is a proxy for general Internet usage. Hard-coding into it
logics to cache one specific website, which may change at any time and
break that code, it is not appropriate.

There are still people offering Squid extensions that do YT caching.
They have kind of gone underground again once it became clear that every
time anyone documented in public how to cache the videos YT developers
would suddenly change how the system worked and break that method of
caching.

FYI: SquidVideosBooster is one product that offers video caching
extensions to Squid if you are looking for one. You will need to combine
it with ssl-bump usage.

Subject: [squid-users] Replacing Microsoft TMG by Squid.
Message-ID: <5FE0959288C73D448BB44CB7E9CC320F5828ACA32B@CPUMAIL2.cpu.qc.ca>

Hi all,

Like you know, Microsoft discountinued the TMG.
The TMG was used as a reverse proxy.
Since many days, I work to replace our TMG by a Squid server v3.5.10 with Oracle Linux 7 x64.
I moved some sites this week but I have a little problem now.
How can I ask LDAP credentials for a user who want to access a directory on another server ?

I currently do that with our TMG.

I used Google but I can only find doc about LDAP auth for users they want to access the internet.

[root at squid squid]# cd /usr/lib64/squid/
[root at squid squid]# ls
basic_db_auth                 basic_pam_auth     cert_valid.pl           ext_session_acl       negotiate_kerberos_auth       url_fake_rewrite
basic_getpwnam_auth           basic_pop3_auth    digest_edirectory_auth  ext_time_quota_acl    negotiate_kerberos_auth_test  url_fake_rewrite.sh
basic_ldap_auth               basic_radius_auth  digest_file_auth        ext_unix_group_acl    ntlm_fake_auth
basic_msnt_auth               basic_sasl_auth    digest_ldap_auth        ext_wbinfo_group_acl  ntlm_smb_lm_auth
basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth  basic_smb_auth     diskd                   helper-mux.pl         ssl_crtd
basic_ncsa_auth               basic_smb_auth.sh  ext_file_userip_acl     log_db_daemon         storeid_file_rewrite
basic_nis_auth                cachemgr.cgi       ext_ldap_group_acl      log_file_daemon       unlinkd

Thanks.

Sebastien

In my setup exists these helpers:

Note: This is transparent interception proxy, not reverse, not
forwarding. Basic auth enabled by default, it required for cachemgr.

:-) disabling auth is not going to be much help to someone wanting auth
to work.

So LDAP is being attempted to be built. But it may not be if any of the
dependencies (the LDAP libraries etc) are missing.

Check the config.log file created during build to see if the LDAP
helpers are actually built or "Found but cannot be built".

By directory are you meaning the AD? a filesystem directory, or
something else ?

User clients access URLs through Squid.

Hi Amos,

Thanks for your reply.

I've tried setting the rp_filter values to 1 and 2 and there is no
difference in behaviour.

Traffic isn't being tagged on dport 3128 directly. What I meant was I
needed to exclude the configured outgoing IPv6 address at the DD-WRT
router level with a PREROUTING rule, otherwise there was a loop and
traffic would be messed up.

Enabling the via header temporarily, I checked to see what was being
passed. According to my tests, the IPv6 address of my proxy was the
value, so the traffic is making it to the Squid box, but no IPv6
requests are logged in the access.log from any TPROXY clients and all
IPv6 requests from TPROXY clients are timing out e.g. ipv6.google.com

I'm pretty confident the problem lies on my Squid server at this
point, I can't see any issues with the policy routing on my DD-WRT route
r.

MTU is configured correctly and the Squid box can ping and traceroute
IPv6 addresses.

I'm really at a loss of what the issue is. I've read the TPROXY wiki
article many times and there is nothing obvious to me that identifies
my issue. I've looked for other resources for TPROXY and IPv6 and
can't find anything else either.

Thanks,

James

Hey Sebastien,

What version of squid are you using? self compiled or RPMs?
It's clear that you do have basic_ldap_auth and you can use that to 
authenticate you users using that.

If you are trying to build squid from sources you will need ldap 
dependencies to be able to build LDAP auth.

I have seen the thread going on and on but you do have 
basic_ldap_auth... so what is the question at all about using that or not?

Eliezer

I have solved it:

my solution not only does certificate checks using OCSP, it also stores 
the real certificates into a different "database" folder;
if someone doesn't want this, just remove the few lines of the shell script;
as there exist no CA that allows IP adresses neither in certificate 
subject nor in the SAN (subject alternative name),

https://www.whitehouse.gov/
(is blocked at my solution because of a root certificate not in the cert 
store)

all these candidates are blocked with error

/X509_V_ERR_CERT_REJECTED/

it uses two components:

- a shell script (BASH) called by the programme
- the main programme (in C): the only missing is an exception list of 
domains/hosts not to validate through this procedure

the squid.conf is expanded by these lines:

<squid.conf>

Subject: [squid-users] [squid-announce] Squid 4.0.1 beta is available
Message-ID: <5624573A.2070005@treenet.co.nz>

The Squid Software Foundation is very pleased to announce the
availability of the Squid-4.0.1 beta release!


This new 4.x series of Squid brings useful new features and changes
providing improved performance over earlier release series.

More detailed descriptions of the major new features are available in
the release notes and wiki:
  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/RELEASENOTES.html>
  <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Squid-4>

Detailed lists of the ./configure build and squid.conf changes can also
be found in the release notes.

This code is released as beta for wider testing purposes and potential
use. There are no more planned alterations to the existing features,
./configure options or squid.conf options.

  NOTE:  Since the 4.0.1 package was bundled there have been some
important issues have been found and resolved. Testers are encouraged to
use the daily snapshot or apply the patches in the "Change Details"
listing where relevant.



This release adds a dependency on C++11 support in any compiler used to
build Squid. As a result older C++03 -only and most C++0x compilers will
no longer build successfully. GCC 4.9+ and Clang 3.5+ are known to have
working C++11 support and are usable. GCC-4.8 will also build for now
despite lack of full C++11 support, but some future features may not be
available.


This Squid version begins the transition from SSL behaviour to TLS
behaviour. While these protocols are often considered to be the same,
they in fact have some small but significant differences. Most relevant
to Squid is the negotiation for RFC protocol version and thus cipher
sets and connection capabilities. Parameters for configuring SSL are
being renamed to TLS options in this version. Other options may be
renamed in upcoming versions.
 Please ensure you run "squid -k parse" to check squid.conf during
upgrade and check the relevant parameters documentation to avoid surprises.


Squid is now capable of configuring Elliptic Curve ciphers in TLS. These
ciphers are the most secure algorithms currently available, and are
being required by some browser implementations and security policies.
But they do require a slightly different configuration in squid.conf to
enable. More details in the release notes.


Squid is now capable of communicating with ICAP services over TLS.
squid.conf options the connection to these services can be configured
similar to those previously available on the cache_peer directive. See
the release notes for further details.


External ACL helpers can now be passed a much wider range of details
using any of the logformat codes for the format parameter. Whether any
given macro expands is dependent on whether the detail is available yet
in the transaction. Not all access controls have been tested yet - some
regressions may occur, if you find one please report the bug ASAP.


The ID assignment algorthm for helper concurrency channels feature has
been altered significantly. It requires 64-bit ID support in helpers and
will cycle through ID numbers sequentually instead of using the lowest
unused channel. This may require some helpers to be re-designed, and all
32-bit helpers definitely need to be rebuilt with 64-bit ID support. See
release notes for specific requirements on helpers.


SMP support availability on several OS has been improved with the use of
C++11 atomics and shared memory features. These features are
auto-enabled by default. There may be behaviour differences noticed with
memory caching on OS where SMP support was previously being auto-disabled.


Major features dropped:

 * SSLv2 support is officially purged from the code.

RFC 6176 requires new and updated releases of software supporting SSL no
longer provide support negotiating SSLv2 ciphers or protocol behaviours.
This release of Squid removes SSLv2 support including all squid.conf
configuration options used to enable or disable SSLv2 related behaviours.

Manual config file updates may be required to avoid warnings or errors
about unsupported options.

 * basic_msnt_multi_domain_auth removal

The SMB LM helpers were deprecated some time ago. Additionally, the MSNT
multi-domain auth helper has been found to overlap completely with
features still available in the basic_smb_lm_auth helper.



All users are encouraged to give this Squid release a test run as soon
as time permits. All feedback welcome.


Please refer to the release notes at
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/RELEASENOTES.html> if and when
you are ready to make the switch to Squid-4

This new release can be downloaded from our HTTP or FTP servers

  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/>

2. Major new features since Squid-3.5

Squid 3.6 represents a new feature release above 3.5.

The most important of these new features are:

    BLAH

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).

:-) if you are seeing the 3.6 release notes the mirror you are using has
not quite caught up yet. They should be saying 4.x with a lot more text
very shortly.

Hey Eliezer,

I am using the latest version of Squid... 3.5.10.

As you can see, I have the basic_ldap_auth in /usr/lib64/squid/.
Should it be good ?

What are the ldap depencies ?

Thanks.

S?bastien

Hey Sebastien,

What version of squid are you using? self compiled or RPMs?
It's clear that you do have basic_ldap_auth and you can use that to authenticate you users using that.

If you are trying to build squid from sources you will need ldap dependencies to be able to build LDAP auth.

I have seen the thread going on and on but you do have basic_ldap_auth... so what is the question at all about using that or not?

What latest version of squid? an RPM\package based or from sources?

If you have basic_ldap_auth it should be good and you can test it.
I do not know much about your knowledge of LDAP and if you do have LDAP 
in place already but I think you will need to first test the 
basic_ldap_auth and see how it works and then implement what you need.
If you do not have any background with LDAP you will need to learn a bit 
about it first before playing with the authentication.
The examples from older LDAP helpers should work for you in a similar way.

The LDAP dependencies are different from OS to OS and I do not have a 
running Oracle Linux I can fetch the exact package names but it should 
be something with "ldap" and "devel".
try "yum search ldap|grep -i devel" and you will might see the relevant 
package there.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Hi Eliezer,

As I wrote, " I am using the latest version of Squid... v3.5.10."
On Oracle Linuxm the latest version is 3.3.8 so I compiled it my Squid from SOURCE with the configure command:

I found this link but I don't know if this link is up to date...

I checked and I already have the openldap-devel depencies installed on my OS.

Thanks for your help! ;)

Hello Sebastien,

Here I tried to have the step-by-step visual tutorial for Squid + Kerberos SSO with AD (using mapped user and NOT by joining Squid into AD) - but is doesn't work for non joined machines (defaulting to Negotiate/NTLM).

May be helpful as a starting point for your own research - see http://docs.diladele.com/administrator_guide_4_2/system_configuration/active_directory/index.html

Please share your findings/critical views on this.

Best regards,
Rafael Akchurin
Diladele B.V.

Hey Sebastien,

The link is from 2012 which means that some changes were done to squid 
since then.
But leaving the names of the binaries aside it should work almost the same.
Still the question I have asked about the LDAP and AD is pretty important.
It will be much different to setup the LDAP to work with AD rather then 
using a simple openLDAP directory.

Also it depends on what you do have there.

I had the chance to work with openLDAP but not with AD, I have tried but 
was unsuccessful making it work with a 2008+ AD.

Message-ID: <56253D3D.9010802@ngtech.co.il>

In order to allow better testing and to reduce the need to build squid 
from sources I have built the latest beta version RPMs.

Details are at:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/CentOS#Squid_Beta_release

The latest daily snapshot from the 17/10/2015 was built as squid-4.0.1-2 .

Later to come 3.5.10 RPMs for CentOS 6 and 7(after I will finish their 
tests) and 4.0.1 with ecap support.

Are you expecting the results from the two accesses to be the same?

If I enter http://www.cpu.qc.ca into my browser (no proxy involved) I get a 
webpage talking about "maximize your IT value".

If instead I enter http://cpu.qc.ca into the same browser, I get an error 404 
"Fichier ou r?pertoire introuvable."

So, are you certain that http://cpu.qc.ca should actually be available for 
Squid to fetch?

Hi again,

Thanks you very much for your prompt answer.
@Yuri: Before I switched to Squid, twice addresses pointed to the same page.
I used a TMG and it worked perfectly.

@Anthony: Yes, I expecting the results from the two accesses to be the same.
Its what I ask since the beginning ;)

This post was just in place since I wanted to add a section to the 
StoreID wiki.

StoreID is great but it gives a limited functionality.
Any site that present ETAG in the response breaks the StoreID functionality.
I have tested in the last couple weeks more then one site with a custom 
StoreID helper and it seems that since squid recreates the object 
HASH\STOREID it makes the StoreID helper decision useless.

I was considering the options to solve the issue in the past but nothing 
has been done until now.
Alex mentioned the option to Give ICAP the option to return a StoreID 
based on the response from the service.
I can see couple issues with this approach since on any ICAP response 
for a RESPMOD the body part is important and an integral part of the answer.

So even if someone claims to cache some sites with StoreID some sites 
cannot be de-duplicated using StoreID until some patches will be applied 
to squid.

Sorry, re-post in plain-text..

Hi All,

I've been following the guide at this location for Active Directory integration
http://wiki.bitbinary.com/index.php/Active_Directory_Integrated_Squid_Proxy
 
First, some versions for sanity..
Ubuntu : 14.04.3 LTS
Squid  : 3.3.8 (from ubuntu repositories)
Samba  : 4.1.6-Ubuntu
DC     : Windows Server 2012 R2
 
I am currently testing the authentication, negotiate kerberos and basic ldap are both working correctly. However ntlm is not and I don't seem to making any progress on debugging further.
 
Here is the relevant part of squid.conf
 
### negotiate kerberos and ntlm authentication
auth_param negotiate program /usr/lib/squid3/negotiate_wrapper_auth -d --ntlm /usr/bin/ntlm_auth --diagnostics --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --domain=DOMAIN --kerberos /usr/lib/squid3/negotiate_kerberos_auth -d -s GSS_C_NO_NAME
auth_param negotiate children 10
auth_param negotiate keep_alive off
### pure ntlm authentication
auth_param ntlm program /usr/bin/ntlm_auth --diagnostics --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --domain=DOMAIN
auth_param ntlm children 10
auth_param ntlm keep_alive off
### provide basic authentication via ldap for clients not authenticated via kerberos/ntlm
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid3/basic_ldap_auth -R -b "DC=domain,DC=local" -D proxyuser at domain.local -W /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt -f sAMAccountName=%s -h dc1.domain.local
auth_param basic children 10
auth_param basic realm Internet Proxy
auth_param basic credentialsttl 30 minutes
### ldap authorisation
external_acl_type memberof %LOGIN /usr/lib/squid3/ext_ldap_group_acl -R -K -S -b "DC=domain,DC=local" -D proxyuser at domain.local -W /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt -f "(&(objectclass=person)(sAMAccountName=%v)(memberof=cn=%g,OU=Proxy,DC=domain,DC=local))" -h dc1.domain.local
 

With kerberos and ldap working correctly, this seems to cover all my users, except for non-domain joined internet explorer, which unfortunately I still need to cater for.
For testing I have allowed the proxy user to login.
 
The following commands work successfully as proxy user
 
wbinfo -p
wbinfo -u
wbinfo -g
 
wbinfo -t does not run successfully as proxy user, but does run as root.
 
testing ntlm_auth at the command line works correctly.
 
ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic
DOMAIN\user password
OK

When a non-domain joined user with internet explorer attempt to use the proxy, they are continually prompted for credentials. In /var/log/cache.log, I see:

Thank you.

I think I see where the confusion is coming from. We need to teach you
both how dstdomain and proxying works.

* Lets start with dstdomain.

This line: acl cpuwebacl dstdomain cpu.qc.ca

... matches *only* the http://cpu.qc.ca/ requests.

This line: acl cpuwebacl dstdomain www.cpu.qc.ca

... matches *only* the http://www.cpu.qc.ca/ requests.

Because the values in the dstdomain are *exact* domain FQDN.


This line:
  acl cpuwebacl dstdomain .cpu.qc.ca

.. matches any request for cpu.qc.ca *and* for any sub-domain such as
www.cpu.qc.ca, helloworld.cpu.qc.ca, etc.
Because the '.' prefix makes it a wildcard match.


So what you have been doing is switching the ACL from accepting the main
domain FQDN and its www.* subdomain. But not both at once.



* Secondly, proxying.

The purpose of the proxy is to pass on the client request as
transparently as possible. Note that "transparent" here has the literal
meaning of transparency. As in the request received is almost exactly
what gets passed on.

I suspect that TMG did not proxy the requests but interpreted and
translated a request for the main FQDN to www.*, or vice versa. Squid
does not do that. Squid passes the *actual* client request URL to the
origin server and expects that server to be fully aware of the URLs it
is serving up.

If your origin server is broken and cannot handle the real client
requests, there are workarounds. But the best thing is to fix the server
so it will work propery regardless of a proxy being in front. So lets
try that first.

As Anthony mentioned the 404 is coming from the origin. Find out why and
fix it, or if its okay ignore it.

There are several problems involved here.

1) NTLM is a proprietary protocol deprecated by its corporate creator in
2006 and officially has not been part of any MS products created after
that year.

With some trouble it can be enabled. But now, 9 years later, it is off
by default almost everywhere, or literally not existing in the new
products code.


2) NTLM has *never* worked properly over HTTP, particularly in the
presence of proxies.

Most of HTTP performance and optimization features have to be actively
disabled the instant NTLM auth is identified as happening.


3) off-domain clients have *never* been able to authenticate with NTLM
protocol.

Previously Squid helpers were performing a MITM downgrade attack on the
client software to cause it to use LanManager auth over "NTLM" tokens
then decrypting the user:pass credentials in real time and using the
Basic auth login to AD to authenticate. (sounds nasty? it is). LanMan
protocols are even more deprecated (since 1996) and non-existent in
modern MS software than NTLM.

 - NTLMv1 can still be MITM'd but takes longer. I think the older Samba
helpers maybe do that. But no guarantees.
 - NTLMv2 and v2 with security extensions are not able to be MITM'd.

So they wont work through Squid unless the client is "on-domain".


4) support for NTLM sub-protocol inside the "Negotiate" auth scheme is a
relatively new feature and still not working quite right.

Partially because of the above problems and deprecated nature of NTLM
meaning it is a low priority to fix. Partially because NTLM is also not
matching the behaviour requirements of Negotiate protocol itself.


5) The cache_effective_user or cache_effective_group directives are not
compatible with WinBind helpers.

see
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Authenticate/Ntlm?highlight=%28winbindd_priv%29#SMBD_and_Machine_Trust_Accounts>
for details on what to do there.


6) if you self-compiled Samba or Winbind tools on Ubuntu systems there
may also be a /var/lib/samba/winbindd_privileged directory created by
the winbind and ntlm_auth tools with root ownership. The group of that
folder needs to be changed to match the
/var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged location.


Your version of Squid has big problems with (4) and some with (2), and
your DC server version has big problems with (1) and (3).

Fix the helper. It is sending garbage output back to Squid. Which is
sometimes being treated as (wrong) responses to waiting lookups, and
sometimes logged as you can see when there are no waiting lookups to
corrupt.

Despite the lack of wording it is an error. And a rather serious one
that corrupts the security operations you are expecting the helper to
perform for many transactions.

SG is outdated software and no longer being maintained. There are some
patches it needs to have applied to talk with Squid 3.4 or later.

Or you can move to a helper like ufdbguard which is still maintained.

Or you could move your SG rules into squid.conf, where most of them
should have been to begin with. That will speed traffic up by not having
to wait for helper lookups.



PS. please upgrade your Squid version too. 3.5.10 is the current release
and has several serious bugs and security issues fixed.

Try to see how ETAG will affect when it's different on each request...

Eliezer,
I'm not sure it's due to the Etag only...
I did many tests and some with Etag are cached and some are not.
But it seems objects including a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" cannot be
cached with a Etag. I don't know if it's related or not, maybe you know 

Bye Fred

The chunked should not affect squid caching as far as I can tell how 
squid works.
If you indeed have seen this I encourage you to report a bug.
The ETAG can affect drastically when validating objects.
The situation I know about ETAG is like this:
- more then 1 mirror
- each of the mirrors supply different ETAG for the same content\file
The above will result in a situation which a if modified re-validation 
will see the different ETAG and will decide that the object is not the 
same as the one exists in the cache.
My test subject was fedora and CentOS mirrors which have this issue and 
StoreID usage to de-duplicate content from two or more mirrors causes 
invalidation of cached content and a re-fetch each and every time.

I had in mind an idea to write in the wiki about the different things 
which can prevent StoreID usage to be useful, if you can contribute from 
your experience to this addition I will be grateful.
Of-course this is a off list topic.

What is the question exactly?
the latest can be seen at:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/

I have asked in the past to have some http api that will redirect to the 
latest squid stable version sources.
I think it will be good to have but for that you should file a bug at:
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Project%20Services
under "Packages" or "WWW Site" but I am unclear under what exactly it 
should be.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Message-ID: <20151020154947.Horde.MkuPY1Mxju5p8MXnZRANOvZ@aws-it.at>

Dear squid team,

first of all thanks for developing such a great product!

Unfortunately on uploading a big test file (unencrypted POST) to  
apache webserver using a squid proxy (V 3.5.10 or 4.0.1) the upstream  
pakets get slized into thousands of small 39 byte sized pakets.

Attached you can find a tar file containing squid configuration,
test network topology, network trace from traffic from client to squid,
network trace from squid to webserver and a full debug log from squid

One incoming paket of size ~ 1500 bytes gets sliced into more as 40 pakets.
On the target webserver the squid upstream traffic therefore looks  
like a DOS attack.

The problem can be reproduced using squid 3.5.x and squid 4.0.x (32bit  
and 64bit variants)
The where no such problems using squid 3.2.x

Hopefully you can help me to fix this problem as this is a showstopper  
for me to upgrade to squid 3.5.x and higher.

Best regards,

Toni

I think, this is very bad idea.

Proxy is not AV-software, and blind update may lead you production proxy
to death.

Subject: [squid-users] POST upload splits tcp stream in many small
 39byte sized pakets

Hey Toni,

I have not reviewed your tcpdump captures but I have briefly reviewed 
your squid.conf.
The number of packets per second would not be accounted as a DOS unless 
the admin of the service don't really know what it means.
The TCP stack allows a connection to send small packets if there is a 
need and it is a part of the TCP open and available options for the 
public use.

I recommend you to open a bug in the bugzilla using this link:
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Squid

And choose the "other" component and 3.5 as the version and as confirmed.

I have also tested this issue now after reading your issue and it seems 
to be quite real.
The test I was running was on latest 3.5.10:
[root at proxy]$ http_proxy="http://192.168.10.150:3128/" curl -X POST -H 
"Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@/tmp/storeid_db" 
http://ngtech.co.il/favicon.ico >/dev/null

And the tcp dump result was fascinating:
[root at www1]$ tcpdump -n port 80
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes

Chunking affects caching code because chunked responses do not have
Content-Length headers, and Squid makes many decisions, including
decisions about caching, based on available/anticipated/received/etc.
body sizes.

Whether chunking plays a role in this bug report, I do not know, but it
should be possible to tell if one can reproduce the problem.

And that's what I think. Daily updates - it's not what you need for a
productive system. Do not broke - do not fix it. I'm easy, by
subscribing to a mailing list about new releases, check out the release
notes, think, do I need this, if necessary, download the new version and
run the script to compile and install, that I wrote in advance. With an
argument in the form of source archives.

I have tested 3.5.10 with the patch in bug 4353 and it seems to speedup 
the upload by a lot and also the length of packet got increased to more 
then 39 bytes.
There is a reduction between thousands of packets to couple hundreds.

Message-ID: <5FE0959288C73D448BB44CB7E9CC320F5828ACA37D@CPUMAIL2.cpu.qc.ca>

Hi,

I would like to monitor Squid with Centreon using SNMP.
I configured Squid using http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Snmp

## SNMP Configuration
acl snmpcpu snmp_community cpuread
snmp_port 3401
snmp_access allow snmpcpu localnet
snmp_access deny all

netstat -ano | grep 3401
udp6       0      0 :::3401                 :::*                                off (0.00/0/0)

BUT

When I try to do a snmpwalk, I got a timeout.

[root at bak ~]# snmpwalk xxxxxxxxxx:3401 -c cpuread -v 1
[root at bak ~]#

Anyone monitor Squid using SNMP ? Do you experiment some issues ?

Thanks for your answers community!

Only for linux sounds a bit specious - I can understand not for Windows
but other unix operating systems should be close enough.

Hi Amos, 

Thank you for your detailed answer.

So what is the best way to authenticate users in a mixed environment? I've got Windows domain PCs with IE/firefox/chrome. Linux PCs with Firefox/chrome. Windows non-domain joined PCs with IE/firefox/chrome - plus various mobile devices.

I've tried getting rid of ntlm and just using negotiate kerberos and ldap for basic, is that all I need?

On the non-domain joined PCs, if I disable 'Enable Integrated Windows Authentication', they now correctly use basic ldap.

My config now looks like..

### negotiate kerberos and ntlm authentication
auth_param negotiate program /usr/lib/squid3/negotiate_kerberos_auth -d -s GSS_C_NO_NAME
auth_param negotiate children 10
auth_param negotiate keep_alive off

### provide basic authentication via ldap for clients not authenticated via kerberos/ntlm
auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid3/basic_ldap_auth -R -b "DC=domain,DC=local" -D proxyuser at domain.local -W /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt -f sAMAccountName=%s -h dc1.domain.local
auth_param basic children 10
auth_param basic realm Internet Proxy
auth_param basic credentialsttl 30 minutes

### ldap authorisation
external_acl_type memberof %LOGIN /usr/lib/squid3/ext_ldap_group_acl -R -K -S -b "DC=domain,DC=local" -D proxyuser at domain.local -W /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt -f "(&(objectclass=person)(sAMAccountName=%v)(memberof=cn=%g,OU=Proxy,DC=domain,DC=local))" -h dc1.domain.local

Does that look ok?

You can use ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/squid/ directory. The latest 
two releases from each series are listed there in numerical order.

PS. note that v3 is no longer the latest Squid.

Also, if you are testing and/or want to follow the daily updates use the 
URL labelled "Source rsync" which is provided on each series download

I?m getting these very frequently for api.github.com and github.com

I?m using the same DNS servers as my intercepting squid 3.5.10 proxy and they only return the one IP when I do an nslookup as well ?

Any updates from your end, Roel?

I believe thats at least very close to the solution. The getting rid of 
NTLM is something that needs to happen at the client end though, so IE 
does not attempt to use it over Negotiate scheme.

And thats the way to do it IIRC. Someone more familiar may know a better 
way.

Looks reasonable for a small installation. If you have a medium to large 
network you may find Squid mentioning queue issues and requesting more 
helper children be configured. Simply increasing the numbers there 
should resolve that.

it was just the solution I did for myself,

  Dear Alex,

unfortunately not really fixed.

The upload speed using squid 4.0.1 with this patch has bettered significant
but is far away from squid 3.4.x performance.

The used test client can reach a maximum upload speed of 115 MBIT if the
apache server is directly reachable.
If a SQUID 3.4.X PROXY is inbetween, the speed is also 115MBIT but only
16MBIT when USING SQUID 4.0.1

TcpSegmentOffloading has been turned off for this dump:
(Note: turning off TSO to see the real packet sizes the measured speeds are
nearly the same.)

Dear Alex,

using squid 3.5.10 with patch the upload speed problem seems to be fixed.
Now I get 112Mbit upload speed from a possible maximum of 115Mbit.
Squid 4.0.1 still has a performance problem on unencrypted POST upload ...

     You're not getting timeout, you're getting no data, which is 
completly different from timeout.

     Try giving the initial MIB number and you'll probably get the data:

[root at firewall ~]# snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost:3401 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.1.0 = INTEGER: 419756
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.2.0 = INTEGER: 96398932
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (77355691) 8 days, 
22:52:36.91
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.2.1.0 = STRING: "webmaster"
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.2.2.0 = STRING: "squid"
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.2.3.0 = STRING: "3.5.8"


     and to make things easier, i use to configure the SNMP daemon that 
runs on UDP/161 to 'proxy' requests to squid, so i dont need to worry 
about informing the correct port:

[root at firewall snmp]# grep proxy snmpd.conf
# proxying requests to squid MIB
proxy -v 1 -c public localhost:3401 .1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1


     so i can 'snmpwalk' on the default udp/161 port: (note the lack of 
:3401 port)

[root at firewall snmp]# snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.1.0 = INTEGER: 419964
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.2.0 = INTEGER: 96359504
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.3495.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (77370521) 8 days, 
22:55:05.21

I recommend monitoring and updating bug 4353. The patch posted there is
most likely not the final fix, and you can help by testing future patch
versions if any.

Subject: [squid-users] big files caching-only proxy
Message-ID: <5627D5AC.5060509@solutti.com.br>


     Hi,

     I have a running setup for proxying only 'big' files, like Windows 
Update, Apple Updates and some other very specific URLs. That's working 
just fine, no problem on that.

     For avoiding caching small things on the URLs i want to have big 
files proxied, i setup the 'minimum_object_size' for 500Kb, for example. 
That's doing just fine, working flawlessly.

     Now i'm looking for caching instagram data. That's seems easy, 
instagram videos are already being cached, but i really dont know how to 
deal with the small images and thumbnails from the timetime. If i lower 
too much the minimum_object size, those will be cached as well as not 
wanted data from the other URLs.

     Question is: can the minimum_object_size be paired with some ACL ? 
Can i have a minimum_object globally and another one for specific URLs 
(from an ACL) for example?

     i'm running squid 3.5.8.

Message-ID: <81613B56-2277-4F77-BF91-C28AC84C4F1D@gmail.com>

Hello, 
So what I am trying to accomplish here is to basically have a whitelist of domains that is allowed via http/https. If the UID is squid,apache, or root then basically you will bypass squid and anything is allowed. This was working well on 3.4.2 however once I moved to 3.5.10 it no longer works properly. I also noticed that there are ?new? features peek,slice etc which is probably my issue since I was not using it. I have tried several combination and have only gotten it to work for http traffic. All https traffic is currently being blocked by the configuration. Below are my configurations.  I don?t need to "inspect" any of the traffic just want to have a whitelist of allowed domains if you are not UID squid,apache, or root via http/https. Any help would be appreciated !!

HTTPS forward port: this is SSL Bumped port, or what? Where, in this
case, ssl-bump directive? On the other hand, you don't need use cert/key
for tunneling connections. This is enabled by default long, long time.

Subject: [squid-users] Squid/NTLM Auth
Message-ID: <b61d22509f934b0da363009c5c6f5e29@de36s02aexc02.ucc.merckgroup.com>

I have squid running on Centos 7 and am trying to setup AD authentication.  I have samba/winbindd installed and the system was added to the domain with authconfig.  I have tested authentication with auth_ntlm and that works. I have also tested group membership with auth_ntlm and that works as well.  When attempting to access squid with either IE or Firefox I am presented with the authentication dialog box.  Manually entering credentials does not work.  What debugging can I enable to see what is going on?  Squid is built with the following

Squid Cache: Version 3.5.9-20150917-r13917
Service Name: squid
configure options:  '--prefix=/usr' '--includedir=/usr/include' '--datadir=/usr/share' '--bindir=/usr/sbin' '--libexecdir=/usr/lib/squid' '--localstatedir=/varsquid' '--sysconfdir=/etc/squid' '--enable-auth' '--enable-auth-ntlm' '--enable-external-acl-helpers' '--enable-auth-negotiate' '--enable-auth-basic' '--enable-auth-digest'

I answered your questions below. However https traffic is still always being denied even though the site is on the allowed_list via nobumpSites.
I want to control http/https traffic using the ?allowed_domains? list. This current configuration works for HTTP but not HTTPS traffic.

If there is an easier way to do this I am open for suggestion. This configuration minus the peek/splice part works fine in 3.4.2. Not sure what changed in
3.5 that causes this to fail.

Usually Squid uses in conjunction with
redirector+Apache/other_web_server, so in these setups the shortest (and
weak) way is using it...

But Rafael is right.

Hi Yuri,

Thanks you very much for your answer.

My question was Remote Desktop Gateway with my Squid.

A Remote Desktop Gateway and RDP is not the same.

Thanks.

My question wasnt that.
I want to change the Squid?s logo?

Nothing else?
Im sure I need to change something else if I want the Squid?s logo replaced?

Did you ever replace the Squid logo ?

Thanks.

Sebastien.

Look more:

http://www.experts-exchange.com/Software/Anti-Virus/Q_24387982.html

and more.

More closed:

In transparent proxy setups RDP is not a problem everywhere, because of
transparent proxy utilizes only HTTP and/or HTTPS ports.

RDP is not uses this ports in case you are using mstsc.

In forwarding proxy case, the best way is use NAT/firewall to bypass RDP
connection by proxy.

Squid it is not intended to understand all of the protocols. :)

You are talking about logo, which is hosted on external web-site.

You can:

1. Use your own local web-server with another picture and point ERR_PAGE
to this location.
2. Use Rafael's method as descrubed.
3. As Amos to get administrative rights on squid-cache.org, upload your
own picture and point your ERR_PAGE onto it. ;)

Could you suggest a configuration that you think should be working ? I would like both HTTP/HTTPS domains whitelisted via file all other domains blocked. What am I missing ? My assumption here is the acl nobumpSites ssl::server_name "/etc/squid/git_allowed_domains/allowed_domains? part is not working for https but does work for http.

Hi,
  I suspect (unverified) that

acl dom dstdomain .example.com
acl type rep_mime_type base/type
http_reply_access deny dom type
http_reply_access allow all

will do what you need

The above config leaves the following question unanswered:

Q: What happens if neither spliced_hosts nor net_bump match at bumping
step #2?


Leaving questions unanswered is a bad idea for ssl_bump rules because
defaults are complex (and used to be broken). To answer that question
(instead of forcing Squid to guess the answer), add a forth catch-all
rule. For example, this is how the latest Squids would guess:

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump splice spliced_hosts
  ssl_bump bump net_bump
  ssl_bump splice all


If spliced_hosts ACL negation works reliably, then the above is
equivalent to:

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump bump !spliced_hosts net_bump
  ssl_bump splice all

but I recommend avoiding ACL negation in the actual rules.


Finally, please make sure your http_access rules correctly handle
CONNECT requests (real for forwarded connections and fake ones for
intercepted connections). This may be difficult to do right now due to
bug 4340: http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4340


HTH,

Alex.
P.S. I renamed get_sni_at_step1 to step1 in the above examples because
that ACL itself does not know anything about SNI and does not force
Squid to get SNI.

Alex,
So what do you recommend to do here ? I just need a simple whitelist file for both http/https. I have a config that works on 3.4 but would like to upgrade to 3.5 and the current config we have won't cut it. Just need a simple if you are in this list allow if not deny. No need for any ssl validation or anything.

Hi,

I have a question regarding the SSL Server Certificate Validator.

In the Wiki is written:
"The helper will be optionally consulted after an internal OpenSSL validation we do now, regardless of that validation results."

What checks does the internal validation include ?

Couldn't find any information's about that.

It sounds to me that you are not so much wanting to cache only big
things, you are wanting to cache only certain sites which contain mostly
big things.

The best way to confgure that is with the cache directive. Just allow
those sites you want, and deny all others. Then you dont have to worry
about big vs small object size limits.


Though why you would want to avoid caching everything that was designed
to be cached is a bit mystifying. You might find better performance
providing several cache_dir with different size ranges in each for
optimal caching to be figured out by Squid.

What you have actually configured is a whitelist with MUCH narrower

Ok. That is iptables/ip6tables. Not Squid related.

I'm not sure how you define "inspect" exactly. But the config implies
that your Squid actually does need to do TLS inspection.

Like Yuri said the above line(s) are bad. Very bad.
They are instructing Squid not to verify the TLS to upstream servers are
secure. That allows any MITM upstream to be done on them without any
type of warning or alerts. Not only that but Squid will relay valid TLS
security to the clients, so they believe everything is just fine when in
fact they could be badly hijacked.

The always_direct hack from Squid-3.1 bumping is no longer useful.

I think the problem here is that you are requiring the "http://" and
"https://" scheme be part of the URLs.

Your description of the whitelist did not mention any such criteria.

Squid-3.5 uses CONNECT requests (where the URL has *no* scheme segment)
to represent the initial TCP SYN connection happening before the HTTPS
stream starts. Your whitelist rules here will reject those because they
lack the https:// scheme portion. And thus reject all HTTPS traffic.

If you have cache_effective_user or cache_effective_group directives in
your config file remove them. They break the Winbind helpers group
permissions.


Were your successful tests made using the Squid low-privileged user
account ?
 If no, then your test results are not relevant. Re-test as the Squid
user. Which will need membership of the winbindd_priv group.

What Windows version are the IE and Firefox being run on?
If it is newer than Windows 2000, then you should be moving to
Negotiate/Kerberos authentication instead of NTLM.

Does the client machine have Windows Integrated Authentication enabled?
and is it on-domain?
 Off-domain machines have no chance of NTLM working. Disable their
integrated authentication settings.
Note that without the integrated auth Firefox has no access to NTLM
credentials and MSIE has a tendency to use the machine credentials
instead of the users.

You should list Basic as first choice since it is the more secure of
those two protocols.

Sounds like a joke, but it is true NTLM is less secure these days than
Basic auth. Namely because clients that accept NTLM can be
auto-downgraded by attackers to using LanMan protocols that broadcast
the username and password just like Basic - BUT most network software
treats Basic auth as the insecure one and do a lot more to protect its
weak credentials.

The above implies that the authenticated users will be outside the LAN
(localnet). The 'L' in NTLM is "LAN" and old 1980-1990's style flat LAN
networks are where it was designed for use. It does *not* work properly
over Internet connections or even in many of todays complex LAN
environments.

You need Negotiate/Kerberos auth for Internet clients to even have half
a chance of authenticating securely. Then you also need to get the whole
on/off domain thing sorted out and working.


PS. you will probably need a few hundred helpers for NTLM. It is an
*extremely* inefficient protocol. I've not seen even a home network
operate with less than 50, usual minimum is 100.

The other config files that sit next to squid.conf.

One of them is called errorpages.css. It contains all the CSS display
and layout settings for the error pages. Including where the logo image
is loaded from (the squid-cache.org website, an inline data: thing like
Rafaels tutorial mentions, or a local Squid hosted file).

The other is called mime.conf. This one contains a mapping of the
well-known URL path prefixes to specific icon images Squid loads into
cache. You can load any image you like into the Squid logo URI path
instead of the SN.png one.

Like Yuri said Squid is not designed to be compatible with every
protocol. Just HTTP and where possible HTTP based ones. So RDG and RPC
are only supported so far as they obey HTTP protocol requirements (ie
RESTful principles and behaviour).

That said, the above log lines look to me like they are working fine. At
least as far as Squid is concerned.
* The 404 is a server API being tested and found disabled or unavailable.
* The 401 is the server requiring authentication from the client before
RPC access is permitted. Which is fine and good. I would be worried if
it did not.
* all requests are being sent via the cache_peer.

Then you are wanting the same as what kinkie provided, but with
store_miss instead of http_reply_access.

You know it really helps if you read the documentation. Which is
particularly easy when you already know what the directives you want to
use are.

Best Practice is not to have NTLM at all. In the same way that its best
practice not to use 8-bit (1 letter) passwords.


NTLM was formally deprecated in 2006 by MS. Kerberos was added in 1998.
You should not be using NTLM at all by now unless you are running
software that has not been updated since before 2001 and still requires
NTLM as its only possible authentication scheme.

I'm really not joking when I write that Basic auth is more secure than
NTLM. The simple fact that everyone is aware of the weakness in Basic
auth credentials means a lot of extra protection has gone into keeping
them secure and safe. NTLM can trivially be auto-downgraded to LanMan
which is just as insecure - but still treated widely as if it were a
magically "secure and unbreakable" auth even though its crypto was
obsolete almost 20 years ago.

The "internal" validation is done by OpenSSL library. So whatever it is
doing based on the configuration you give it.

I believe that includes X.509 certificate syntax validity, and X.509
properties validity in light of the TLS extensions negotiated on the
connection, and a check the cert was signed by one of the system default
Trusted-CA authorities (unless flags=NO_DEFAULT_CA was used) or a custom
CA you loaded (with cafile=/capath= options).

There may be more (or less) happening but that is the bulk of it. And
all inside OpenSSL so we can't easily debug the what/when/how of it when
the output messages are obscure.

Message-ID: <875EC9DECC66D547B0E5B4328642CEDBDFC11D5F@CG003SERVER.camegroup.local>

Hi, I'm facing a problem with the digest auth server responses.

Client requests a page, server responds with 407 + nonce, client gets the page correctly.
At every "200 OK" response the server sends a "Proxy-Authentication-Info: nextnonce ..." header, even if the "nonce_garbage_interval" is 5 minutes.
Client then tries to get the next page using the same auth data used before (this is a client problem, not involving squid), gets a  407 + new nonce, then gets correctly the page making a new request with the new auth params.

The Squid problem here is that the server gives the "nextnonce" header in every "200 OK" response.

POST http://my.server.com/my/page HTTP/1.1
[...]

HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
Proxy-Authenticate: [digest info, nonce="<nonce1>"]
[...]

POST http://my.server.com/my/page HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: [digest info, nonce="<nonce1>"]
[...]

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Proxy-Authentication-Info: nextnonce="<nonce2>"
[...]
(gives a new nonce at every 200 OK answer)

POST http://my.server.com/my/page HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: [digest info, nonce="<nonce1>"]
[...]
(client using the old auth params..)

HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
Proxy-Authenticate: [digest info, nonce="<nonce3>"]
[...]

POST http://my.server.com/my/page HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: [digest info, nonce=" <nonce3>"]
[...]

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Proxy-Authentication-Info: nextnonce="<nonce4>"
[...]

...

squid.conf digest settings:

#  TAG: auth_param
auth_param digest program /usr/bin/php /etc/squid3/mydigestscript.php
auth_param digest children 5
auth_param digest realm MyProxyRealm
auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes
auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 2 hours
auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50

Any suggestion?

I just did a quick test of api.github.com and what I'm seeing is only
one IP at a time being delivered. BUT that IP is showing signs of being
geo-DNS based result and also has a 60 second TTL.

So ... when using the Google "free" DNS service it changes IP number
almost every second. Based on which of the Google servers you happen to
be working through with that particular request.

You can watch it cycling if you like:
 watch dig A api.github.com @8.8.8.8


You could run a local bind server and redirect UDP port 53 requests from
clients to it so they stop using 8.8.8.8 etc and start using a DNS like
its supposed to work.

Ah-ha. Thanks for digging into that a bit Amos.

In my case 8.8.8.8 is the tertiary server, so I?m surprised it?s being used at all. Could be a local DNS server is forwarding to it, though.

I?ll remove that from the equation tomorrow and see how it fares.

Cheers

Hi Amos ,

thanks for your reply.

Maybe we got an misunderstanding or I have an "false" opinion of the sentence I quoted before.

I thought you could say to me what for checks would definitely performed in "standard" installation with openssl,

not only that you believe that the X.509 certificate syntax and properties would be checked in correctness and the signer.

I?m sorry for these remark , but for me it's important to know what checks would performed to prevent another on the same thing and slow down the "process".


Another question regarding the Options from "sslcrtvalidator_program",
ttl " TTL in seconds for cached results. The default is 60 secs"

Is the cached results referred to the sslhost ?

For example , I configured that the TTL is 12 hours.
A request from Client A is performed to https://www.google.com the validator report back to squid that the certificate is ok and the connection would be spliced/bumped,
1 hour later Client B perform a request again too https://www.google.com , would squid use the "cached" answer from the validator used ?


And another question regarding the cache option.
What from the response would be cached , the complete one or maybe only the sslhost and response code ?

Would it be defined as byte in as the validator and speak ?

The "internal" validation is done by OpenSSL library. So whatever it is doing based on the configuration you give it.

I believe that includes X.509 certificate syntax validity, and X.509 properties validity in light of the TLS extensions negotiated on the connection, and a check the cert was signed by one of the system default Trusted-CA authorities (unless flags=NO_DEFAULT_CA was used) or a custom CA you loaded (with cafile=/capath= options).

There may be more (or less) happening but that is the bulk of it. And all inside OpenSSL so we can't easily debug the what/when/how of it when the output messages are obscure.

Dear squid-users, 

Our infrastructure rely on squid as a reverse-proxy to serve most of our web 
applications. Our tests show that squid won't correctly handle an HTTP request 
to initiate a WebSocket connection. We'd like to know if we are missing 
something, or if the support of WebSocket is planned in the future. 


Thanks in advance.

Squid explicit/forward proxy should relay the WebSockets CONNECT request
to upstream WebSockets servers just fine.

In all other cases Squid should be negotiating that HTTP/1.1 be used
instead of WebSockets. That is one of several proper outcomes from
protocol negotiation. It is also the correct outcome given that Squid is
an HTTP proxy, not a TCP or SOCKS proxy, and does not have native
WebSockets support.

Currently it is an "I believe" because I am only part way through
learning the SSL related code and refactoring it for TLS support. Those
are the checks I have seen being enabled to happen so far, there may yet
be some more hiding elsewhere later in the transaction handling.

They are all configurable, and in my experience it is a rarity for
people to actually use the default config settings. Normally we see
configs being posted disabling the verifications or restricting ciphers
and OpenSSL feature usage.

The X.509 syntax and TLS extension checks are all library dependent to
begin with. The squid default config just enables the library to do its
default of those, and to check the system CA signings. Everthing else,
including whether the helper is used is administrative choice.

Understood.

FWIW the result of the above checks (what gets done) gets passed to the
helper.

I'm not sure. I've not reached the validator helper code yet in my
refactoring. IIRC that is the helper lookup cache TTL. To prevent the
helper being queried for the identical work multiple times in a row. All
helpers have such a cache. The cache key is the exact byte sequence for
the "line" passed to the helper, excluding the channel-ID field.

If a) my recollection is right, and b) the internal validation results
in the same helper query details being passed to the helper, then yes.

If something happens like different TLS extensions being negotiated and
resulting in even slightly different error message from internal
validation - then the lookups will be different and a re-check will be
needed.

The helper response cache stores helper response "lines", excluding the
channel-ID. So it can act as if the helper was queried but produced the
same result as previous lookup.

8 bits is one byte. This is network terminology, not specific to the
helper. The helper protocol is UTF-8 capable, though usually only the
ASCII characters are used.

The garbage interval is only about how often Squid attempts to discard
already obsolete nonce values. Meaning they have to be obsolete already
judging by either the duration or count values for GC to matter.

Hi Amos.
Thanks for your reply.

Squid Cache: Version 3.4.8

On:
Linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 (debian-kernel at lists.debian.org) (gcc version 4.8.4 (Debian 4.8.4-1) ) #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt9-3~deb8u1 (2015-04-24)

Maybe a known and solved bug?

I suspect its bug 4176. Please check if a helper lookup is being
performed on each request as well as new nonce generated.

If I change "ssl_bump bump net_bump" to "ssl_bump bump all? It starts up but it still fails to allow any https through even those on the whitelist_ssl file but allows http to those domains. Not sure what I am doing wrong here.

Hi Amos.

> Please check if a helper lookup is being performed on each request as well as new nonce generated.

I guess you are right, but I don't know how to solve it.
cache.log doesn?t show restarts for the heelper, even if only 1/5 helper is started.
The output log of the helper shows no caching of the result (see later).
On the contrary, the external type helper shows the result is cached for 30s (correct).

Okay, that would make it the side effect of the CVE-2014-9749 fix (aka.
bug 4066) that was included in the Debian package doing its job overly-well.

Its unfortunatey verbose, but should not be a huge problem.

I would put the "to_vpn" first on those lines. Since the non-to_vpn
transactions dont seem to need authenticating.

Prevent things being stored in Squid's cache is what that does, yes.

Creating an ACL which will only match during SSL-Bump operations at step 1.

> acl whitelist_ssl ssl::server_name "/etc/squid/git_allowed_domains/allowed_domains? <? Create whitelist for SSL 

Sort of yes, sort of no.

This is creating an ACL which will match if some domain name(s) are used
in CONNECT authority-URI (at SSL-Bump step 1 or 2), TLS SNI values (at
SSL-Bump step 2), or X.509 certificate SubjectAltName field (at SSL-Bump
step 3).


> 
> ssl_bump peek step1   <? Try to find server_name ?

Try to find client handshake details. One of those is the SNI which is
often the best available datum on what domain the client is trying to
connect to.

This will always match at step 1. So peek is aways done to find SNI,
NPN, ALPN etc.


> ssl_bump splice whitelist_ssl <? Ignore whitlist_ssl domains and let it through

At step 2 attempt to match the whitelist ACL against the details we have
for server domain names. SNI if known, otherwise the CONNECT requests
authority-URI.

At step 3 (because this is checked at both step 2 and 3). Attempt to
match the whitelist ACL against the X.509 certificate SubjectAltName
details.

What is supposed to happen if the whitelist does not match ?
Take your policy requirement and make Squid do it.

No. Create an ACL which matches when URL scheme is "http://"

Yes.

No. Create an ACL which matches when URL scheme is "https://"

No. Create an ACL which matches when URL port is 80.

No. Create an ACL which matches when URL port is 443.


> 
> http_access allow http port_80 whitelist    <? Allow whitelisted domains on port 80 

No. Allows requests where there is a URL scheme http:// AND going to
port 80 AND on the whitelist.

> http_access allow https port_443 whitelist_ssl <? Allow whitelisted domains on 443
> 

No. Allows requests where there is a URL scheme https:// AND going to
port 443 AND on the whitelist.

NP: HTTPS requests arrive as CONNECT mesage to URL with no scheme, and
going to port 443. May be a hostname not on the whitelist. For
intercepted traffic this request message will always have a raw-IP
instead of a hostname or domain name.


> http_access deny al <? Deny all 

No. deny whatever "al" matches.

Then the default action of allowing everything else.

Don't assume. Squid tells you what is wrong:

That is because the traffic is mostly intercepted and those
fake/synthetic CONNECT requests have "CONNECT IP:port HTTP/1.1".

raw-IPs are not in your whitelist. Your http_access rules do not permit
non-whitelisted URI to be serviced. Thus they are rejected before
bumping even starts to find out what the SNI/domain the client was
trying to connect to was.

I was able to confirm that ntlm_auth worked for the squid user.  We currently use BlueCoat proxies so IE is definitely configured to use integrated authentication. No cache_effective* in the config.  I will enable debugging and see what is happening as well as enable Kerberos.

Thanks,

Keith

If you have cache_effective_user or cache_effective_group directives in your config file remove them. They break the Winbind helpers group permissions.


Were your successful tests made using the Squid low-privileged user account ?
 If no, then your test results are not relevant. Re-test as the Squid user. Which will need membership of the winbindd_priv group.

What Windows version are the IE and Firefox being run on?
If it is newer than Windows 2000, then you should be moving to Negotiate/Kerberos authentication instead of NTLM.

Does the client machine have Windows Integrated Authentication enabled?
and is it on-domain?
 Off-domain machines have no chance of NTLM working. Disable their integrated authentication settings.
Note that without the integrated auth Firefox has no access to NTLM credentials and MSIE has a tendency to use the machine credentials instead of the users.

You should list Basic as first choice since it is the more secure of those two protocols.

Sounds like a joke, but it is true NTLM is less secure these days than Basic auth. Namely because clients that accept NTLM can be auto-downgraded by attackers to using LanMan protocols that broadcast the username and password just like Basic - BUT most network software treats Basic auth as the insecure one and do a lot more to protect its weak credentials.


>
> acl AuthorizedUsers proxy_auth REQUIRED http_access allow localnet
> http_access allow AuthorizedUsers http_access allow localhost

The above implies that the authenticated users will be outside the LAN (localnet). The 'L' in NTLM is "LAN" and old 1980-1990's style flat LAN networks are where it was designed for use. It does *not* work properly over Internet connections or even in many of todays complex LAN environments.

You need Negotiate/Kerberos auth for Internet clients to even have half a chance of authenticating securely. Then you also need to get the whole on/off domain thing sorted out and working.


PS. you will probably need a few hundred helpers for NTLM. It is an
*extremely* inefficient protocol. I've not seen even a home network operate with less than 50, usual minimum is 100.

     At first that (caching only 'big' things) was the idea, but when i 
look to cache instagram, that really changed. I know i dont have a good 
hardware (I/O limitation) and having a VERY heterogenous group of 
people, hits were low when caching 'everything' and, in some cases, 
access was even getting slower as i do have a good internet pipe. But 
caching windows update and other 'big things' (antivirus updates, apple 
updates, etc etc) still looked interesting to me.

     As you suggested, i further enhanced my ACLs that match 'what i 
want to cache' and could get it working using cache rules. I have even, 
in some cases, created two ACLs, one for the dstdom and other for the 
urlpath for matching just some extensions i want to cache. Maybe not 
perfect, but seems to be working fine after lowering the 
minimum_object_size to some few KBs.

Subject: [squid-users] HTTP performance hit with Squid
Message-ID: <CA+86yMiu+ZMaESB6UngbMhgs3OchoOsP_tkGqgctnTc8bPai0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,
we have been using squid 3.1.20 comes with debian wheezy 7. We could see
there is a peformance hit in http traffic when we use Squid.

For each HTTP GET request coming from client to proxy server, Squid takes
nearly 2 seconds to generate HTTP GET in order to establish a connection
with server.

There is always a ~2 second delay between the request coming to our system
and going out of Squid. Suppose if a page has lot of embedded URL's it's
taking more time with squid in place.Suppose If I disable squid the page
loads very fast in client browser.

What could be the reason? Do I need to tweak any configuration for this?
The first page request always loads slow with Squid.

Could that be DNS? Is the server configured to use valid DNS servers?
Check each of them yourself to see what their response times are like, eg

time nslookup some.valid.site.that.isn't.in.cache

maybe you'll see 2sec show up on one of them...

I was able to confirm that ntlm_auth worked for the squid user.  We currently use BlueCoat proxies so IE is definitely configured to use integrated authentication. No cache_effective* in the config.  I will enable debugging and see what is happening as well as enable Kerberos.

Thanks,

If you have cache_effective_user or cache_effective_group directives in your config file remove them. They break the Winbind helpers group permissions.


Were your successful tests made using the Squid low-privileged user account ?
 If no, then your test results are not relevant. Re-test as the Squid user. Which will need membership of the winbindd_priv group.

What Windows version are the IE and Firefox being run on?
If it is newer than Windows 2000, then you should be moving to Negotiate/Kerberos authentication instead of NTLM.

Does the client machine have Windows Integrated Authentication enabled?
and is it on-domain?
 Off-domain machines have no chance of NTLM working. Disable their integrated authentication settings.
Note that without the integrated auth Firefox has no access to NTLM credentials and MSIE has a tendency to use the machine credentials instead of the users.

You should list Basic as first choice since it is the more secure of those two protocols.

Sounds like a joke, but it is true NTLM is less secure these days than Basic auth. Namely because clients that accept NTLM can be auto-downgraded by attackers to using LanMan protocols that broadcast the username and password just like Basic - BUT most network software treats Basic auth as the insecure one and do a lot more to protect its weak credentials.


>
> acl AuthorizedUsers proxy_auth REQUIRED http_access allow localnet
> http_access allow AuthorizedUsers http_access allow localhost

The above implies that the authenticated users will be outside the LAN (localnet). The 'L' in NTLM is "LAN" and old 1980-1990's style flat LAN networks are where it was designed for use. It does *not* work properly over Internet connections or even in many of todays complex LAN environments.

You need Negotiate/Kerberos auth for Internet clients to even have half a chance of authenticating securely. Then you also need to get the whole on/off domain thing sorted out and working.


PS. you will probably need a few hundred helpers for NTLM. It is an
*extremely* inefficient protocol. I've not seen even a home network operate with less than 50, usual minimum is 100.

What version of squid are you using now?
Squid 3.1.20 is very old and it is recommended to use newer versions.
If you are having specific troubles I think you figure out the issues 
pretty fast.
What hardware are you using for you squid? is it a VM? RAM? CPU?Disk?
How many clients? Have you used the squid cache manager interface?

My first suggestion it to try and use squid 3.4.14 just to make sure you 
are on something more current then 3.1.20.

Subject: [squid-users] Squid 100% CPU and possible attack
Message-ID: <88EF58F000EC4B4684700C2AA3A73D7A04F71C6F9B2E@W2008DC01.ColliniConsulting.lan>

Hello,

sometimes, for about half an hour, tour Squid becomes unstable and, by typing "top -s", Squid is taking the 100% of the CPU.

In Squid's access.log, i see lots of entry like this:

"Thu";"Oct";"22";"11:45:17";"2015";"21328";"192.168.1.250";"TCP_MISS/000";"0";"GET";"http://192.168.1.254:8080/cgi-bin/a2/out.cgi";"-";"DIRECT/192.168.1.254";"-"

There seem be a possible attack/exploit from an internal machine? It is the 192.168.1.250 in the example.

Is there a patch or something to not spread up Squid to the 100% cpu limit for these "Attacks"?

Thank you!
Francesco

Subject: [squid-users] How to inspect client certificate in ssl_bump
Message-ID: <005901d10d14$23d0d290$6b7277b0$@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using Squid 3.5. What I'm going to do is setting up a forward proxy that
inspect TLS handshake between client and server then allow the connection
only when following two requirements are met:

    1. The server address must be in our whitelist, and the server must
provide a correct server certificate during TLS handshake
    2. The client must provide a client certificate during TLS handshake.
And the certificate's subject must be in our whitelist

I've set up the ssl_bump according to this page:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice. I don't need to do
any bump. I only need to peek then either splice or terminate.

My question is - how to inspect the client certificate? And how to configure
an acl for that?

The document is confusing. It explains the peek action as:
peek    step1, step2    Receive SNI and client certificate (step1), or
server certificate (step2) while preserving the possibility of splicing the
connection. Peeking at the server certificate usually precludes future
bumping of the connection (see Limitations).

But client certificate is not sent at step1 during TLS handshake. Client
certificate is sent after server certificate is received and the sever also
send a "Certificate Request" message. So I guess I need an additional step
(step4)? Is there already someone working on this or I need to create by
myself?

Any suggestion is highly appreciated!

Thanks!
Leon

My Squid configuration is:

acl step1 at_step SslBump1
acl step2 at_step SslBump2
acl step3 at_step SslBump3
acl whitelist_server ssl::server_name "/etc/squid/whitelist_server.txt"

http_port 3128 ssl-bump \
  cert=/etc/ssl/ca-cert.pem \
  generate-host-certificates=off dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB

ssl_bump  peek  step1  all                 
ssl_bump  peek  step2  all    
ssl_bump  splice  step3  whitelist_server  
ssl_bump  terminate  step3  !whitelist_server
ssl_bump  terminate  all

Current SslBump code does not support client certificate inspection.
Squid does not know anything about a bumped client certificate.

That is correct. What do you find confusing about the current
description? Please suggest improvements or edit the current text.


> So I guess I need an additional step (step4)?

Yes, although client certificate inspection should most likely be done
during step3 and/or step4, with the current "final" step3 increased to
step4 or step5.


> Is there already someone working on this or I need to create by

I am not aware of anybody working on the client certificate inspection
in SslBump. Please note that correctly handling client certificates
during SslBump requires serious development work and that work needs to
be done in the unstable SslBump code (e.g., we are currently rewriting
handshake parsing code to make it safe and robust).


HTH,

Alex.

The simplest way is to use fail2ban.
What OS are you using?
it is possible an attack but it's not 100%.
What you can do is to also disable access using the proxy to this 
destination IP and address.
100% CPU in many cases is not something odd but you can try fail2ban 
with a special rule to block this client in the iptables of the machine 
(if this is a linux..)

I am using Squid version 3.1.20 running on Intel I7 processor with 16GB
RAM. Even on connecting a single client I could able to reproduce this
problem.

It looks like almost 2 seconds spent in resolving  DNS for an URL. I guess
it could be the reason. Also it tries for IPv6 first even i configured
dns_v4_first option.
It looks bad. Suppose if an URL has many embedded pages a delay of 2 second
is added to total page load time for each embedded page request.

I tried by disabling internal dns in squid. Still i am seeing the same
problem.
What else can be looked at ?  Its really makes user experience bad if he
tries URL for the first time.

That is the type-2 tokens happening. There should be an initial client
request and 407, then repeat client request with type-1 tokens leading
up to this.

The details of that reply message you elided at the end should match the
challenge token, and contain Connection:keep-alive.

Then there is the followup client re-request with type-3 tokens. And the
servers final reply should accept that type-3 token. Ideally it should
also use Connection:keep-alive.

If either of those two latter transactions contains Connection:close
from either endpoint NTLM breaks.


You can drop the tokens into
<http://treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/ntlm_token.php> to see what type
they are.

Internal DNS in Suqid has very little to do with this. The DNS helper
process will be even slower.

There are three problems here.

1) the serial DNS lookups done by 3.1. The fix for that is upgrading to
a current Squid where that is no longer done.


2) the 3.1 behaviour of looking up DNS for each server connection
attempt. The fix for that is upgrading to a current Squid where that is
no longer done.

NP: this is not helped by your "server_persistent_connections off"


3) the 1 second round-trip delays to the Google DNS servers. I know
there is a lot of avertising about how fast Google services are. But
that really is only advertising, some networks it is not true. Yours
appears to be one of those.

I suggest installing a local bind DNS server on your network and using
that. You may need to redirect client UDP port 53 traffic to it to
prevent them getting the bad behaviour from Google DNS or "Host forgery"
complains from Squid.



PS. dns_v4_first sorts the results found in DNS so IPv4 are connected to
first by TCP even if IPv6 is available and working better. It does not
affect the fact that both A and AAAA are being fetched.

That looks like the side effects of a forwarding loop DoS. Look for the
following line in your squid.conf and remove it:

  via off


That should return to Squid its ability to actually detect and abort
looping behaviour quickly and let you find the real problem. I suspect
it is a bad NAT configuration.

Hello Eliezer,

i use Linux CentOS; i think i will study fail2ban.
It seems very very interesting, thank you for the suggestion!

The simplest way is to use fail2ban.
What OS are you using?
it is possible an attack but it's not 100%.
What you can do is to also disable access using the proxy to this
destination IP and address.
100% CPU in many cases is not something odd but you can try fail2ban
with a special rule to block this client in the iptables of the machine
(if this is a linux..)

Hello Amos!

I do not have via off in my squid.conf, so i think it is set to on, default value.

Otherwise, i redirect outbount http/80 to the internal 8080 on firewall/squid machine.
It seems from a specific client someone try to pass an exploit to the 8080 port...

What else should i consider?

Thank you again!
Francesco

the slower pipe you have, the results should caching give you.
Did you try to tune caching options?

For example, replacement policy - I use heap GDSF for memory cache and heap
LFUDA for disk cache.  The latter should give better data rate (will spare
your pipe), while the first better object hit rate (better feel when
downloading web pages)

Caching files below a few KB may not be good for disk, but may be perfect
for RAM.  With COSS or rock storage, even small files should be on-disk
cacheable and that could give you another improvement.

of course, with slow disk i/o you can't get much benefits.

I also guess it's the DNS.
Check what /etc/resolv.conf points to and if all servers there are alive.
Even better, I would run bind or other resolving server locally and point
resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1

Something that would cause a machine to make lots of HTTP requests.

You have provided almost no information about the network, it
configuration, or uses etc. Having eliminated the usual problem(s) it is
a waste of time to guess.

Details please.

I reran the test and checked the tokens and I can see the type 1 and type 2 tokens but no type 3 tokens.  I ran a packet capture and I think I may have found the issue.  Our Windows servers are specifically configured to not resolve external DNS names.  To get around that I configured specific DNS servers in Squid.  These servers are not AD DNS servers and it appears when Squid is trying to authenticate, it is using these servers and not the DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf (these point to Windows). I am going to play around with the DNS servers to see if the behavior changes.

Thanks,

Keith

That is the type-2 tokens happening. There should be an initial client request and 407, then repeat client request with type-1 tokens leading up to this.

The details of that reply message you elided at the end should match the challenge token, and contain Connection:keep-alive.

Then there is the followup client re-request with type-3 tokens. And the servers final reply should accept that type-3 token. Ideally it should also use Connection:keep-alive.

If either of those two latter transactions contains Connection:close from either endpoint NTLM breaks.


You can drop the tokens into
<http://treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/ntlm_token.php> to see what type they are.

That is the type-2 tokens happening. There should be an initial client request and 407, then repeat client request with type-1 tokens leading up to this.

The details of that reply message you elided at the end should match the challenge token, and contain Connection:keep-alive.

Then there is the followup client re-request with type-3 tokens. And the servers final reply should accept that type-3 token. Ideally it should also use Connection:keep-alive.

If either of those two latter transactions contains Connection:close from either endpoint NTLM breaks.


You can drop the tokens into
<http://treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/ntlm_token.php> to see what type they are.

I'm literally stumped at this point. The fact TPROXY is working for
IPv4 indicates that I have the necessary setup in place for TPROXY to
at least work, but IPv6 not working is a mystery. Like I said the
Squid box is fully IPv6 capable and clients connecting via 3128 have a
working IPv6 setup.

I maybe should of mentioned that the server Squid is running on is a
HP Microserver Gen8 it does have multiple NICs, but only eno1 is in
use, eno2 is disabled. I'm pretty sure there is some form of routing
issue at the Squid box, but I've read every bit of information about
TPROXY with IPv6 and I cannot see where I have done something wrong.
Reading many articles on the subject they all hint at the same routing
and ip6tables rules that I am using currently.

I've tried using the loopback interface and eno1 (main LAN interface)
and they both yield the same results for IPv6 connectivity.

I hope someone can chime in with some additional
troubleshooting/debugging steps, because I literally have no idea now!

Subject: [squid-users] [Squid 4.x]: Truncated accounts when there is spaces
	in usernames
Message-ID: <562AD0D8.3090905@articatech.com>


Hi all.

I'm testing squid 4.x with Active Directory connection.

When there are spaces in logged accounts eg : "Jhon Rambo" squid use 
only the last string in logon user "Rambo".

This corrupted account is used in all ACLS and events too and all acls 
matches Rambo and not "Jhon Rambo"

This behavior can be replicated in Squid 3.5x branchs too and be 
replicated in both LDAP/NTLM methods.

* * It should be a security issue and an issue according governments 
laws * *

1) If we create acls for the account "Rambo" that is - an another person 
- of "Jhon Rambo" , Jhon Rambo aka "Rambo" for squid use the same ACLs 
as "Rambo" account.
2) In Europe we must keep Squid logs for the police during 1 year 
according Justice needs. This corruption break logs validity according 
Squid did not reflect the real connected username.

How to fix it ?

Best regards

Hi

I have squid on centos 6. the version that comes with it unfortunately.

I have configured it to be a reverse proxy to our exchange box.

so it answers on office.abc.com
now I have 2 cache peers setup

10.1.1.1. the exchange box << all the predefined URIs go here
127.0.0.1 443 the rest go here.

Its https to 127.0.0.1.

I have sslflags=DONT_VERIFY_PEER in the cache_peer command. It was
suggest to remove this.

But the cert on the end of 127.0.0.1 is office.abc.com. I can't use
cache_peer office.abc.com because it will just hit the squid box.

I also have the cert define sslcert=/etc/httpd/conf.d/office.abc.com.crt

Is that going to cause an issue, the is no subjAlt for 127 in the cert
name. will squid just check the certs.

Let me re ask, as I have miss understood what sslcert is used for.


if cache_peer points to 127.0.0.1 433 and the cert coming back says
office.abc.com with no subj alt for 127.0.0.1 will squid complain ? if
so how can I get around without using the DONT_VERIFY option

Wish I could give some better help. But there have been a few situations
where people have ended up in the same mystery situation with TPROXY and
one of us found a solution yet. That was usually on Debian/Ubuntu
systems though. Whatever the bug was did seem to get fixed in more
recent kernels for them.

Start with whats in your squid.con settings. proxy_auth values, helper
settings.

Then go on to what the helper protocol is transmitting. both request and
reply lines from the auth and external ACL helpers.

Whitespace in user labels is not always dealt with nicely.

Set the cache_peer sslcafile= option with the PEM file containing the CA
that was used to sign the office.abc.com server certificate.

Since your peer has raw-IP you may also need to set
ssldomain=office.abc.com to inform verification that is the domain the
server cert is for.


You may also want to use sslflags=NO_DEFAULT_CA to prevent hijacking by
agents with rogue global CA certs on the peer connection.

Do i need to do that if the signing CA is part of the OS root bundle ?

No, in that case you don't have to. Just "ssl ssldomain=" should work fine.

Subject: [squid-users] Access regulation with multiple outgoing IPs
Message-ID: <1445698198127-4673900.post@n4.nabble.com>

Hey guys, 

im trying to setup squid for windows. I have different IPs on my server and
i want to assign them to VMs:
VM1 --> Outgoing IP1
VM2 --> Outgoing IP2
...

So far this is working! But now i want to deny all other IPs to avoid false
access. So all VMs have the same incoming IP (i think) but the outgoing IP
changes by port. 

Can you help me to set up the access regulation and deny all unwanted
adresses?

Okay. I think there is nothing we can do about it except to say you
can't have whitespace in usernames when using the old-style helpers.
That currently still includes ntlm_auth from Samba.

It is not a new problem. The NTLM/Negotiate helper response lines have
an optional token field before the username and the line is whitespace
delimited. If the username has whitespace inside it, then the first part
is parsed as being that field. It should be %-encoding the username,
which seems not to be happening.

We moved to the key=value protocol as the solution to avoid that in
future. But it requires the helper(s) to be using the new protocol. And
this one is not doing that either.

Correctly updating the localnet ACL definition to contain the LAN ranges
should be enough. The default configuration settings then take care of
permitting only those LAN clients to use the proxy.

You seem not to know how Squid ACLs work. This may help:
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl>

Hint: you dont have a port named "src" or "213.xxx.xxx.83/24" in your
config file.

The above http_access control rules are permitting anything that arrives
in the http_ports to use the proxy. No restrictions.

Update the localnet ACL to match your LAN ranges, and remove these
"http_access allow vm*" lines.

So, no restrictions on what protocols clients can send through the proxy.

The above rule is designed to prevent clients using your proxy as a
relay for Spam, or other types of cross-protocol attacks. Removing it is
*very very dangerous*.

If the SSL_Ports is not permissing some needed protocol to use CONNECT
tunnels, just add that protocols server port(s) to the SSL_ports list.
Do not turn off the proxy security completely.

Like it says. Your rules should be at this point. Especially anything
involving http_access.

Don't just comment that highly dangerous line out. Erase it to avoid
temptation to make an Open Relay / Open Proxy.

Hi gents,

Pay attention to whether someone from the test SQUID 4 as extremely low
of cache hits from the new version? Particularly with respect to sites
HTTPS directive "no cache"? After replacing the Squid 3.4 to 4 squid
cache hit collapsed from 85 percent or more on the level of 5-15
percent. I believe this is due to the exclusion of support guidelines
ignore-no-cache, which eliminates the possibility of aggressive caching
and reduces the value of caching proxy to almost zero.

This HTTP caches normally. However, due to the widespread use of HTTPS
trends - caching dramatically decreased to unacceptable levels.

Noticed there anyone else this effect? And what is now with caching?

Hey Amos,

thank you very much for your very helpful information. Now i have an access
control an SSL is fixed too but i had to add port 80 as SSL port to use the
proxies as https proxy in proxifier.

One more question. Now i can use the proxies from
193.xxx.xxx.x1/255.255.255.xxx. But if i want to use the proxies from a
virtual machine i can not get access to them. I tried different Ips. Do you
know what IPs or information i have to add to the acl on top  to get the VMs
working? Thank you so much!


This is my file with working access regulation and SSL fix:

I think you are right Amos, but could you explain why in 3.2x, 3.4x 
branchs (exactly 3.4.6 ) there is no issue.
And samba was the same version...

Hey Yuri,

I am not sure if you think that Squid version 4 with extreme low hit 
ratio is bad or not but I can understand your sight about things.
Usually I am redirecting to this page: 
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID/CollisionRisks#Several_real_world_examples

But this time I can proudly say that the squid project is doing things 
the right way while it might not be understood by some.
Before you or anyone declares that there is a low hit ratio due to 
something that is missing I will try to put some sense into how things 
looks in the real world.
Small thing from a nice day of mine:
I was sitting talking with a friend of mine, a MD to be exact and while 
we were talking I was just comforting him about the wonders of Computers.
He was complaining on how the software in the office moves so slow and 
he needs to wait for the software to response with results. So I 
hesitated a bit but then I asked him "What would have happen if some MD 
here in the office will receive the wrong content\results on a patient 
from the software? he described it to me terrified from the question 'He 
can get the wrong decision!' and then I described to him how he is in 
such a good place when he doesn't need to fear from such scenarios.
In this same office Squid is being used for many things and it's crucial 
that besides the option to cache content the possibility to validate 
cache properly will be set right.

I do understand that there is a need for caches and sometimes it is 
crucial in order to give the application more CPU cycles or more RAM but 
sometimes the hunger for cache can consume the actual requirement for 
the content integrity and it must be re-validated from time to time.

I have seen couple times how a cache in a DB or other levels results 
with a very bad and unwanted result while I do understand some of the 
complexity and caution that the programmers take when building all sort 
of systems with cache in them.

If you do want to understand more about the subject pick your favorite 
scripting language and just try to implement a simple object caching.
You would then see how complex the task can be and you can maybe then 
understand why caches are not such a simple thing and specially why 
ignore-no-cache should not be used in any environment if it is possible.

While I do advise you to not use it I would hint you and others on 
another approach to the subject.
If you are greedy and you have hunger for cache for specific 
sites\traffic and you would like to be able to benefit from over-caching 
there is a solution for that!
- You can alter\hack squid code to meet your needs
- You can write an ICAP service that will be able to alter the response 
headers so squid would think it is cachable by default.
- You can write an ECAP module that will be able to alter the response 
headers ...
- Write your own cache service with your algorithms in it.

Take in account that the squid project tries to be as fault tolerance as 
possible due to it being a very sensitive piece of software in very big 
production systems.
Squid doesn't try to meet the requirement of "Maximum Cache" and it is 
not squid that as a caching proxy makes a reduction of any cache percentage!
The reason that the content is not cachable is due to all these 
application that describe their content as not cachable!
For a second of sanity from the the squid project, try to contact 
google\youtube admins\support\operators\forces\what-ever to understand 
how would you be able to benefit from a local cache.
If and when you do manage to contact them let them know I was looking 
for a contact and I never managed to find one of these available to me 
on the phone or email. You cannot say anything like that on the squid 
project, the squid project can be contacted using an email and if 
required you can get a hold of the man behind the software(while he is a 
human).

And I will try to write it in a geeky way:
deny_info 302:https://support.google.com/youtube/ 
big_system_that_doesnt_want_to_be_cached

Eliezer

* P.S If you do want to write an ICAP service or an ECAP module to 
replace the "ignore-no-cache" I can give you some code that will might 
help you as a starter.

Actually, I'm experienced enough not to need retelling truths. I'm aware
of, and how difficult it is to cache dynamic content, and it's exactly
what I wrote Vicki why it is impossible to cache YouTube :).

It's not about that. It's about the fact that, with exactly the same
parameters caching and maintaining the cache at the same URL, which I
used to get 85% cache hit, I am now, with a SQUID 4, I get 0%. That's all.

OK then, if it's that important for you and it worth money for the 
business you are running\working for think about writing an ECAP module 
or an ICAP service that will do this same thing and sometimes will do 
more then you are asking for.

I didn't mentioned this before but you if you are using a non tproxy 
environment you can use two squid instances to get the same effect.
You would be able to asses the network stress you have and decide which 
of the solution is for you.
Maybe you are already know the article I wrote at:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator
Which you can use to use a similar thing.

 From my side of the picture I think you are over-simplifying the issue.
I cannot speak for everyone and I know that there are other opinions 
about this subject and similar other but, I can say for sure that from 
what I have seen, squid have had many issues which resulted from the 
basic fact the it was something like a "geany in lamp" project which 
many just asked for something they needed.
If you do not know, some literally *hate* squid.
One of the reasons is that it has a huge list of open bugs which are 
waiting for someone to find them attractive enough to write a patch for 
them.

And yes with exactly the same parameters which resulted in 85% cache hit 
you are now getting 0% like you should have been.
I am not sure how many users are happy with this change and I encourage 
others to write their opinions and ideas about it.

I am staying with my suggestions for a set of solutions for the specific 
issue.

I am not the greatest squid programmer but if someone will fund my time 
I will might be able to write a module that will do just what you and 
maybe others want. And if I might add that it's like in any other 
software, you have an API and you can use it. if you think it's 
important file a bug and send your question to the squid-dev list with 
hope that you will get some answers even if these will not be to your 
liking.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

I can not understand why so much dropped for caching of https. This is
very critical in the modern conditions, for obvious reasons. In older
versions of the same for this to work. And it does not have the
slightest desire to write or use a third-party services or crutches. As
well as the search for workaround for functionality that worked yesterday.

Message-ID: <CAJ+Q1PV-LentXKqTaQgq8=0LczMNM07hiAyGb4e=K6W9s2STcw@mail.gmail.com>

HI

I have had a look at http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/DelayPools

Wondering if somebody can maybe explain how it rate limits downloads.

So I can understand it would be able to limit proxy to client traffic
as squid is the sender and can limit how it sends.

But if I want to limit speed from say microsoft.com to the
organisation how does it organise that.

My limited understanding is you make a request of the ms web servers
and then they send it as fast as they can.

The only way I can think of it happening is slowing the TCP ACK's.  Or
does squid make request for partial ranges of files such as to fit in
the speed requirements.

I cannot speak for the Squid project and you may ask the squid-dev more 
about it and also see the release notes about it.
What I can is that the phrase "it's not a bug, it's a feature" can work 
the other way around "it's not a feature, it's a bug" and as you have 
mentioned "it worked yesterday" and yes... some will look at this as a 
bug from a caching point of view.

Well, I don't think it is what you think.

For starters ignore-no-cache was removed back in 3.2, so your 3.4
version working okay shows that its not that parameter.

Secondly, what ignore-no-cache did when it was supported was *prevent*
things marked with Cache-Control:no-cache by servers from caching. Quite
the opposite of what most proxy admin seemed to think.


What has been removed in 4.x is:
1) ignore-auth which again was preventing things being cached,

2) ignore-must-revalidate which was causing auth credentials, Cookies,
and per-user payload things to be delivered from cache to the wrong
users in some/many proxies.

As a result ignore-private is now relatively safe to use. Before it
utterly wiped out cache integrity when combined with the (2) behaviours.

Also ignore-expires is now safe to use. Since Squid should be acting
like a proper HTTP/1.1 cache with revalidations of stale content.


60% -ish sounds about right for the proportion of traffic using
Cache-Control: with any of must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, no-cache,
private, or authentication.

If you are only looking at *_HIT you will see a massive decline. But
that is an illusion. In 4.x you need to count REFRESH_UNMODIFIED as a
HIT, and look at the cache ratio statistics for near-HITs as well as HITs.



Right after the upgrade from an older Squid it could be a case of your
cache having bad content in it. The revalidations would cause a burst of
replacements until that old content is updated. You would see that as a
sudden low point in the rate, increasing roughly exponentially back up
towards some new "normal" rate.

If you are having the huge decline even after revalidations are taken
into account and the new normal rate is reached, that is not expected.
You would need to analyse your traffic headers to find out what the
actual situation is.

I dont understand what you mean by that.

You started caching HTTPS and ratio dropped?


HTTPS is less than 30% of total traffic. But;

* has a higher proportion of Cache-Control: private or no-store
messages, and

* the store entries for URI with http:// and https:// are different
objects even if the rest of the URI is identical.

* has a larger amount of Chrome 'sdch' encoding requests.

Any one of the above can cause more MISS by increasing the churn of
non-cacheable content. The wider object space is also trying to fit into
the same cache space/capacity, reducing the time any http:// or https://
object will be cached.
 Don't expect HIT rates for HTTP+HTTPS caching to be the same as for
HTTP-only caching. You likely need to re-calculate all your tuning.

Quite simple. Each request transaction gets assigned into some pool(s)
based on your delay_parameters and delay_access settings.

Each time a read(2) from the server connection is requested the pools
are checked to see what size is permitted, and the smaller of the
permitted size or the wanted size is read in.

To limit client traffic use client_delay_* pools settings. They operate
the same but for reading on the client connection.

Note that simply trottling read(2) operations is not great. It ignores
all the TCP level transactions, and bandwidth from other protocols
outside HTTP, and even some parts for HTTP traffic done before a pool is
assigned (ie the HTTP headers on some requests). It is far better to use
the available OS level QoS functionality for bandwidth control.

No. Just those of you having it.

I am suspecting that the problem is related to CONNECT tunnels. Since
HTTPS traffic is on the rise, the tunnel handling did not used to do
delay pools (counting upload traffic but not delay it), and I'm not sure
if that got fixed or not.

I'm not sure why 3.4 would work and not 4.x. The code has not changed
since 3.4.2, and not in a way that would affect this since some time
back in 3.3.

These do not seem right:

The clients are on network 193

But Squid is listening and sending with network 178.

Hopefully that is enough to resolve your issue. I can't help any further
without the numbers which you are eliding and a lot more details about
the network topology configuration.


PS. Squid uses modern CIDR subnet masks, not the 1970's netmask format.
If the xxx mask bit does not exactly match a CIDR mask it will be mapped
by dropping/0-ing the rightmost mask bits until it does.

Hey Yuri,

What have you tried until now to understand the situation of the issue?
 From your basic question I was sure that you ran some tests on some 
well defined objects.
To asses the state of squid you would need some static objects and some 
changing objects.
You would also be required to test using a simple UA like a 
script\wget\curl and using a fully fledged UA such as 
chrome\firefox\explorer\opera\safari.

I can try to give you couple cache friendly sites which will show you 
what the basic status of squid.
In the past someone here asked how to cache the site: http://djmaza.info/
which by default is built using lots of static content such as html 
pages, pictures and good css and also implements cache headers nicely.
I still do not know why wordpress main pages do not have a valid cache 
headers, and what I mean by that is: Is it not possible to have a page 
cached for 60 seconds? how much updates can accrue in 60 seconds? would 
a "must-revalidate" cost that much compared to what there is now?(maybe 
it does).
Another one would be https://www.yahoo.com/ which is mostly fine with 
cache and define their main page with "Cache-Control: no-store, 
no-cache, private, max-age=0" since it's a news page which updates too much.

I was looking for cache testing subjects and I am still missing couple 
examples\options.

Until now what have mainly used for basic test was redbot.org and a 
local copy of it for testing purposes.
And while writing to you looking for test subjects I have seen that my 
own web server have a question for squid.
I have an example case which gives a great example how to "break" squid 
cache.
So I have my website and the main page:
http://ngtech.co.il/
https://ngtech.co.il/ (self signed certificate)

that would be cached properly by squid!
If for any reason I would remove the Last-Modified header from the page 
it would become un-cachable in squid (3.5.10) with default settings.
Accidentally I turned ON the apache option to treat html as php using 
the apache configuration line:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm

Which is recommended to be used by the first google result for "html as 
php".
Once you will try the next page(with this setting on):
http://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/
https://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/ (self signed certificate)

You will see that it is not being cached at all.
Redbot.org claims that the cache is allowed it's own freshness for the 
object but squid (3.5.10) will not cache it what so ever and no matter 
what I do.
When I am removing "http as php" tweak the page response with a 
Last-Modified header and can be cached again.

I am unsure who is the culprit for the issue but I will ask about it in 
a separated thread *if* I will get no response here.(sorry for partially 
top-posting)

Subject: [squid-users] Size of icap request chanks
Message-ID: <562E0132.2080506@gmail.com>

Hello All.

I have a question about the size of ICAP request chunks. What is it and 
is there a way to make it configurable?

I've made an investigation here and looks like Squid 3.5.9 separates the 
ICAP payload on little chunks with the size of 27 bytes.
Like:
27
2345678912345
012345678912345
012345678

27
912345
012345678912345
012345678912345

27

012345678912345
012345678912345

My ICAP configuration part is:

/icap_service service_req reqmod_precache 
icap://192.168.0.121:1344/reqmod bypass=on//
//icap_enable on//
//icap_preview_enable off//
//icap_send_client_ip on//
//icap_send_client_username on//
//icap_client_username_header X-Authenticated-User//
//icap_io_timeout 30 seconds//
//icap_service_revival_delay 30//
//adaptation_service_set ICAPSRV service_req//
//adaptation_access ICAPSRV allow all/


Thank you for any your help.

I understand perfectly. However - I changed version of the proxy and 
everywhere at the same time changed the headlines? Now I will return the 
version 3.4 and everything will be as it was. I already did.


That's why I ask the question - what has changed so much that the same 
configuration I get 10 times smaller cache hit.

This is a very low value, a new nonce will be generated very very frequently

Subject: [squid-users] range_offset_limit and idm
Message-ID: <1445860831139-4673926.post@n4.nabble.com>

regarding range_offset_limit   no matter what i do idm or any download
manager not working correctly

try to download using idm and it start downloading one file suppose to start
downloading multiple of chunk range setting idm to download 16 chunk range
at the same time only one start downloading once it finish downloading first
part it start the second one after the other and that is bad  wen i pause or
stop then resume downloading all the chunk range start normal downloading
same time that is normal behavior 

only new file at the start it download one chunk insted of multiple until i
hit stop then resume so squid respond only to one range wen the new file
start 
hitting stop then resume    squid working good with all the range
downloading same time 
and that big time issue since most of my customer using  idm or any download
manager file not cached 
i duno if i explain it right but over squid supost to respond to all the
range as idm rquest at the begining of the download if i bypass   squid idm
work correctly

Message-ID: <CAGRJihXT7DTv7RqOTmtTaRr5h2+ONGiTaqk56x235PMnFJx+jA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am running squid 3.5.10 for bumping transparent SSL connections To
achieve this I am using following squid configuration for SSL Bumping.

acl nobumpSites ssl::server_name "/etc/squid/allowed_SSL_sites.txt"
ssl_bump peek step1 all
ssl_bump peek step2 nobumpSites
ssl_bump bump step3 nobumpSites
ssl_bump bump all


File "/etc/squid/allowed_SSL_sites.txt" contains www.facebook.com.

On reading documentation I understood that I should see a Fake CONNECT
request for Facebook.com IP address as below:

TAG_NONE/200 0 CONNECT 17.151.224.13:443 - ORIGINAL_DST/17.151.224.13

And at Step2 there should be a Fake CONNECT request for SNI
information extracted.  But I do not see this either in access.log or
in my ecap adapter.

Please could anyone suggest me how Fake Connect request with SNI
information of the HTTPS site.


Thanks,
Jatin

I have investigate better about the problem that brings up CPU and Squid process over 100%!
We have this situation: Dansguardian on port 8080 and Squid on port 3128.

The The problem appear when telnetting, from LAN, to:
<ip_firewall_proxy>:8080

Squid process raise up, in few seconds, to 100% and nobody can surf..

I disabled NAT, to make sure it was not a loop of iptables-transparent proxying redirection.

Have you good some suggestions for us?

Thank you again!

It is the size of data ready to be written on the socket when a write is
scheduled. For the full details on the chunked transfer encoding see
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1>


No it is not configurable. It depends on the proxy I/O speed. If Squid
is doing little else but shuffling packets around the chunks get
smaller, if CPU is taken up with other processing enough that data
accumulates in the buffers then the chunks get bigger.

This is probably a side effect of the bug 4353 / 4206 issue on the main
I/O socket from the client. On a fast Squid the small input blobs being
read in would stay small though all the rest of Squid operations,
including the chunk sizes written to ICAP.
See if the workaround patch in the bug report helps:

Hey Job,

There are still missing parts.
If telnet or nc results with this it usually means bad setup(considering 
the information).
You will need to describe in more detail your setup with subnets+routers 
and iptables rules on the CentOS machine.
What do you do in the telnetting? just running "telnet ip:port" ?
If so then something is wrong on the squid box and it is probably not 
related to squid itself.
What is your squid version? "squid -v", "yum info squid"(if installed 
from RPMs).

Have you tried telnetting squid port and not the danshguardian port?
What is it resulting with?

Eliezer

Hello list,

Since morning i have a strange problem with my squid. First i saw that the Proxy authentication in Firefox and IE didn't appear.

On my Suse Enterprise Server 11 SP3 i saw with rcsquid status: dead.

After a rcsquid restart i got a running.

But i didn't change a thing because i cant still authenticate with user name and password in IE or Firefox.

When i do a squid -Ncd10 i get:

Sounds right. idm is sending multiple parallel Range requests.
Essentially trying to fake faster downloads by forcing as many resources
to be consumed by the one user as possible. This is a very unfriendly
client behaviour - stealing bandwidth and resources from other users who
need to share them, at all network layers from the CPE device outwards
to the server itself.


Squid is an optimizing proxy. Parts of its design is to baulk that type
of behaviour and make the network operate better for all. In particular
it optimizes bandwidth consumption when you set range_offset_limit by
fetching the entire object from the beginning of the download so that it
can cache and server followup requests from the cache without consuming
any server-facing resources at all regardless of number of users wanting
that URL.


If you dont use range_offset_limit then all fetches made by idm are
Range request and cannot be cached to improve the experience for other
clients needing the same URL/download. Each and every time a new object
gets fetched, but in small pieces and hogging some of the potentially
limited upstream bandwidth by the user with idm.

When range_offset_limit is configured...

* idm has made 5 Range requests in parallel.

What that means is that it has sent 5x requests to Squid for the same
object. But not the same data out of it, which makes them each a unique
fetch.
 So... Squid starts fetching 5x downloads of the file (ouch, you can
enable collapsed_forwarding to reduce that).

 Squid quickly reaches the start of the Range connection #1 requested
and starts delivering it. BUT, it has not reached the download positions
connection #2, #3, #4, #5 requested.

All idm can see is connection #1 receiving data and the rest waiting.

Then at the end of #1 connection Range Squid also hits the point where
it has received the start of connection #2's Range and starts serving
that up.

Meanwhile connection #3, #4, #5 have not yet been reached, and so it
continues until all the Ranges have been fetched and delivered or idm
goes away.


When using a proxy tools like idm are useless. Their abusive
"optimizations" do more harm than good when they do "work".

Try to disable squidGuard and see if it solves the issue.
Maybe a bad update for squidguard caused some issue with the startup of 
the helper.
Also try to run the same command that is being used by squid to start 
squidGuard in order to start and debug the issue.

* squid 2.7 is not supported anymore and I was pretty sure that SUSE 11 
SP3 supply a newer version of squid.

Correct. SUSE 11 came with Squid-3.1.

And, SUSE 12 was out with Squid-3.3 a whole year ago tomorrow.

Neither is great by our current standards (3.5), but still miles ahead
of 2.7.

Squid is already giving you huge hints:

 "(squidGuard): invalid option -- 's'"



I'm also minded that the only changes anyone has published for
squidGuard in the last few years were my release of patches to make it
handle Squid-3.2+ helper protocol. Any Squid older than 3.2 will have
horrible problems if passed responses from a SG patched with those. They
were only ever intended for use to make SG compatible with a Squid
upgrade to 3.4+.

Hi gents.

There is a good contest for all squidmans ;)

So.

We have wey idiotic protocol - OSCAR, and very antique IM client.

This is ICQ.

So what - it's work via Squid 3.4.x (both transparent and forwarding)
using proxy settings by client.

But - no way we could get it to connect through Squid 3.5 or 4. Never.
Nothing. "Login/password" error. For correct accounts. With right and
working passwords.

So, end  users is in frustration. :)

The question is: somebody knows workaround for this stupid, idiotic and
antique clients?

NB: Yes, Google don't know this too. ;) Google-Fu skills is no matter. ;)

so squid only know the begining of the file start then user can abius

Message-ID: <2F3AADF230295040BDC74C6F96094F3D02246F3F@SRVEXAFA.verwaltung.afa-ag.loc>

Hi,

in my squid setup the sslcrtvalidator_program doesn?t send the data?s that I expect to the helper :-) .
The helper receive the data?s as described in the wiki , expect the "form" of the domain,
here I would expect a FQDN or domain like google.de or ca.google.de but the helper receive a IP.

I create the helper (in my case main.sh) that send all Data?s from stdin to a file ( I wanted to see what the "live" helper would receive).
Below you could see my squid build options and squid.conf ( @ Amos I didn?t implement your tips regarding the acl yet)

On the same machine where squid runs , run an dns server , so I tried with dig to resolve google.de and it resolved without issues.
Also I tried to let squid use another dnsserver without success.
If I should attach the cache.log please say with which debug_options.

You are asking a good question. I do not think anybody knows the exact
answer -- too many things have changed in general to either identify the
changes that have affected your [complicated] setup or to exclude all of
the changes and blame some yet-unknown v4 bug.


However, the following procedure is almost guaranteed to lead you to the
answer:

1. Find a URL/resource that was served from the cache in v3 but became a
miss in v4. You probably have access.logs that can be used for that. If
not, enable them and run more experiments. Since your drop in hit ratio
is so drastic, it should not take long to find a URL that was usually a
hit before and is usually a miss now (or that becomes a hit/miss as soon
as you switch to v3/4).

2. Reproduce the v4 miss with an ALL,9 cache.log and share that log. Do
this using single-transaction command-line tools, with no other traffic
going through Squid. Others on this list can guide you as to what
logging options to use if you do not want to run with ALL,9.

The above requires some work on your part. It is a good idea to run
these tests in a non-production environment (which may require even more
work from you). Needless to say, you are not required to do that extra
work. However, some extra work is most likely required if you want to
get the answer to your question because there is currently not enough
information to answer it.


HTH,

Alex.

The answer is simple.

Look ath this row from 3.5.10 access.log:

1445879345.827     48 127.0.0.1 TCP_MEM_HIT/200 24425 GET
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Teller-Ulam_device.png/200px-Teller-Ulam_device.png
- HIER_NONE/- image/png

We can see a big enoug image from Wiki. Mem hit, yea?

With next request we got TCP_HIT, when image comes from disk cache after
swap out.

Refresh pattern from 3.5.10 related to this URL:

# Other long-lived items
refresh_pattern -i
\.(jp(e?g|e|2)|gif|png|tiff?|bmp|ico|svg|webp|flv|f4f|mp4|ttf|eot|woff2?)(\?.*)?$   
14400    99%    518400     override-expire override-lastmod
reload-into-ims ignore-private ignore-no-store

Then we look in 4.0.1 access.log with the same image:

14458854979.432     48 127.0.0.1 TCP_MISS/200 24425 GET
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Teller-Ulam_device.png/200px-Teller-Ulam_device.png
- HIER_NONE/- image/png

# Other long-lived items
refresh_pattern -i
\.(jp(e?g|e|2)|gif|png|bmp|ico|svg|web(p|m)|flv|f4f|mp(3|4)|ttf|eot|woff2?))(\?.*)?$   
14400    100%    518400    override-expire override-lastmod
reload-into-ims ignore-private ignore-no-store

Did you see principal difference? Ah, yes. 4.0.1 has more than 4 times
bigger mem_cache, 1 Gb. 1st example 3.5.10 has only 256 Mbytes. This is
the reason of miss??????

Both servers has the similar squid.conf. Both images are static.

Well, now we goes to redbot.org and check this URL:

http://i.imgur.com/KiydfT0.png

What we seen?


      Caching

  * This response allows all caches to store it.
  * This response cannot be served from cache without validation.

So, what's wrong with Squid NOW?

Interesting, isn't it?

In the latest Squids, the above config probably does not do what you
want. For nobumpSites, your config is equivalent to:

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump peek step2
  ssl_bump bump step3

which does not work in most cases -- you cannot bump after peeking at step2.

For all other sites, you config is equivalent to:

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump bump step2

which works.


If you want to bump everything, then this should work:

  ssl_bump stare all
  ssl_bump bump all

If you want to bump everything other than nobumpSites (which needs SNI),
then start with something like this:

  ssl_bump peek step1
  ssl_bump splice nobumpSites
  ssl_bump bump all


HTH,

Alex.

Ah, ok:

We see in redbot.org this info in server response:

 Cache-Control: no-cache



So, what? 3.5.10 permit ignore this. 4.0.x - deny.

Squid decides?

Maybe I'll decide what and how to cache in the my setup?

So I think the real question is what HTTP headers are going through Squid?

I think the right question is not "What headers pass through Squid" and
"Why did they pass through a transparent proxy, if the port that is
used, not 80 or 443?"

Please see my previous email if you want to improve your chances of
getting a correct answer to that and other related questions.

In summary: Squid logs why it made an immediate-hit, immediate-miss, or
revalidate-and-then-decide decision. There are approximately 100 factors
that affect that decision. If you want folks to speculate, keep posting
questions. If you want an answer, collect and share those logs.


And, yes, Squid needs a better interface for triaging caching decisions
than studying detailed cache.logs. You already know what to do to add
that very useful feature:

This should be understood as "Life Saving handiwork of drowning." Or "We
change something, but you sort it out, how to fix it, it's the Open
Source, baby";)

So, finally, there is no answer.

PS. If developers do not know - the more we do not know and can not know.

Because thats the way idm was designed. To be greedy. Trying to grab as
much as it can in parallel before the network becomes congested. Its own
behavirou makes the network congested, but only after its already got an
unfairly large share of the pipe.

But things have changed since 56K modems were the top of the line CPE
hardware idm and its type were pretending to optimize for users. In
modern hardware and Mbps+ networks a handful of parallel connections
going at full speed are not going to stress anything. Nor speed it up.


The design assumption that a request will be faster when split into
pieces falls flat when it hits HTTP. Which is about stateless messaging
with caches along the way multiplexing the traffic. Not an end-to-end
stateful single-connection protocol that can be abused.

Yes. But only until idm has received all the bytes up to whatever
range_offset_limit is configured with. Or until quick_abort handling
finishes caching the first Range request ever received. Whichever comes
first.

If this is intercepted traffic then IIRC that is expected behaviour at
present. SNI is new and has not been rolled into every corner yet.

You may need to use key_extras feature for now to send the SNI logformat
value explicitly in a new key=value field.

Or you could look at making a patch to send the SNI instead of HTTP
level "domain" from the CONNECT. Any help getting these annoyances out
of the way is very welcome.

ICQ speaks HTTP on port 80. Not sure about 443, it should at least speak
TLS hopefully with ALPN and/or HTTP inside.

Even so, whats going through (or at least into) Squid is the detail you
need to provide to get a chance at a solid answer.

ICQ, like Skype later, uses special technique to bypass
proxies/firewalls, and conventionally checks, after it native port 5190,
other ports: 80,443,110,25 and other before it can connect to it's load
balancer. Moreover, when use 443, it CONNECT over 443, but not use true
HTTPS, just HTTP (squid writes it in cache.log).

The problem is: ICQ is use not only own protocol-specific port 5190, but
ANY other well-known port, and breaks standard usage of this ports.
Squid can't pass this behaviour. I see no one squid.conf, which can be
clearly pass ICQ.

Hi Alex,

Thanks. I understand this. I want a mechanism by which squid can send
the FAKE connect SNI as HOST request to ecap adapter so that I can
decide whether to bump this connection or not. So do you think this
will not be possible in current release of squid ?

Squid does not generate SNI FAKE CONNECT until we splice at step 2. Do
you know that why squid does not generate FAKE CONNECT request for
bump and peek actions at step2 ?


Thanks,
Jatin

A TCP_MISS that did not get fetched from a server. Hmm.

We do need the logs Alex requested to do anything about it. You know

It also says "this content was negotiated but does not have an
appropriate Vary header". Which is marked as a protocol error.

And has a status code of 400 (unspecified error by the client).

And has passed through three non-Squid proxies without being cached
there either.

Rather bold statement. Where is the cache.log line(s) saying that was
the decision Squid made?

No, the content owner does.

You are just the caretaker of the information. It belongs to its
creators. What you can do with their property depends on what they allow
to be done with it.

HTTP is the legal rights granting methodology they chose to distribute
with. The creators have granted you/anyone the license to cache
(redistribute) that object. They did so via the badly named
Cache-Control:no-cache header. Which comes with the license condition
that the content be revalidated before redistribution.

In other words, the content owner(s) retain the right to veto any
recipient receiving their content or to provide alternative content at
any time.

[[ Given that it seems to flip between an error page and an image
depicting the internal design of a nuclear device - depending on where
in the world one views it from. It would seem that the behaviour is
probably intentional. ]]


Within your new right to cache and redistribute you then get to choose
how long for - on that particular item.


BTW: Revalidate does not lead to MISS. It leads to a REFRESH_MODIFIED or
REFRESH_UNMODIFIED.

IIRC that BH response happens when the helper gets a type-3 token
without having been part of the handshake dance that led up to it. The
helpers are stateful and the same one needs to be part of the whole
handshake.

That can happen if the connection is closed for some reasons after the
type-2 token is sent, and the client is brokenly continuing on a new
connection (Firefox is known to do that, others might too).

The connection is allowed to close after the initial 407 challenge. Some
clients are broken and require that to happen - which is where the
"auth_param ntlm keep_alive off" setting helps.

But not once the type-2 token is sent on the second 407. Squid should be
enforcing a persistent TCP connection from then onwards.

The nextstep is to look at either the HTTP messages or the TCP packet
level to find out what (if anything) is closing the connection between
the type-2 and type-3 token messages thats probably your problem.

The problem is: I can't see most part of ICQ traffic. Because of it uses
non-HTTP/HTTPS/FTP ports. Only with sniffer.

Looks like this:

1. Login starts over 5190 port with CONNECT method. And normal squid's
config blocks it - this is non-SSL port.
2. If we add this port to SSL_ports acl, connect starts via HTTP over
HTTPS port. Squid's prohibit it too. If we relax config (and make it
less secure!), login phase goes next step.
3. And finally Squid got XML-answer via HTTP/HTTPS, which is visible by
squid, and at this moment client got "Login denied, check
login/password". Whenever right or wrong password.

Viola, connection denied completely.

Sure. But in real world we have much, very much unscrupulous webmasters,
such as distributors of advertising or unscrupulous CEOs who abuse their
rights.

This is why we fight againts them with our caches.

Absolutely sure. But this not occurs.

This problem occurs at the same time on different squid's. 4.0.1 leads
TCP_MISS, but 3.5.10 on _the_same_ content gets TCP_HIT or TCP_MEM_HIT.

Okay, that should not matter much. That part of the traffic there is
nothing we can do about in Squid.

Pause, how does Squid prohibit that _exactly_ ?

Maybe somebody else can find a way to do it without loosing security.

Okay. That sounds a bit like it could be from something Squid is adding
(or not adding).

Actually seeing those request and reply messages here would help a lot.

Yes. Although to do it easily will require a Squid-3.4 or later where
transaction annotations are available. Also a helper that sends back the
group=X to Squid about what group(s) the user is in (could be auth
helper or external ACL helper).
 So far only the kerberos auth helper does that and it sends the SSID
value as the group=X value for all the groups listed in the Kerberos token.

With a helper returning the group names to Squid, a "note" type ACL can
be used to check the group=X annotation values in any access control
rules. Including delay_access.

> 

That delay pool requires that an external_acl_type helper is being used
and sending some tag=X back to Squid to attach 'tag' each request /
transaction.

That helper has to be tested on one of the *_access rules where async /
slow group lookups will work. The delay_access rules will *not* work
since they are a fast-group check. http_access is the usual place and
the heper decides both whether to allow use of Squid and what to tag the
request with.


You define the pool to be of class 5 with a Bytes/sec rate:
  delay_pools 1 1
  delay_parameters 1 5 20480

You define delay_access to match for the requests that are to have that
pools traffic rate limit applied:
  delay_access 1 allow localnet

Squid will automatically arrange so each unique tag=X value the helper
assigns to those pooled requests will have a pool. All requests to which
the helper replies 'tag=ZZ' will share a one pool, but requests the
helper replies with 'tag=YY' will have a different pool. etc.
 Requests not having a tag at all share one pool (I think, havent
checked that).

That is it.

The difficult bits are that only one tag= value can be assigned to a
transaction, attempts to repeat or alter one assigned wont work, and
that detail about the async/slow access lists being the only ones where
the helper can be checked.

Facing the same problem,
by default if i didnt use range_offset_limit , idm download the file with
multiple mirros, all are 206 but cant be cached and hit when repeat the same
url download.
when i use range_offset_limit, idm download the file with 1 mirror, this
will decrease the speed but it can be hit when repeat the same url download.
 
so users have problems in this , they use idm because they need to download
the file with multiple mirrors, and in the same time they need it to be hit
when repeat the download file.

there must be a way to cache idm downloads and make the download with
multiple mirrors, right haa ?
Thanks

I?ve got a bunch of services connecting to third party APIs.  Many of these APIs register hits even if squid reaches out to the service to check the HTTP headers (I verified that  hits with the log  TCP_REFRESH_UNMODIFIED/200  are being counted against me with the third party service).

offline_mode on  seems to never return fresh results, no matter what my refresh_pattern is.   I want fresh results every 15 minutes, otherwise return HIT from memory and don?t reach out.  Is this possible?    Perhaps I just haven?t found the right combination of refresh_pattern options.  

Thanks,

	Parent - Sibling configuration question
Message-ID: <000001d1106d$f85f9b70$e91ed250$@optimera.us>

Greetings,

 

I have been wrestling with squid for a while and my reading has brought
"Cache-Digests" to my attention.  I suspect the answer is "that would be
neat, but that's not how it works", but I thought I'd ask a few questions.
I am running an ISP in a remote area only served by satellite links.  The
layout of my network is approximately (yes, very much simplifying here):

 

<Servers-on-Very-Cheap-Connections>
----Internet----<HORRIFICALLY-EXPENSIVE-SATELLITE-LINK> ---- Servers ----
Clients

 

We use the servers on the cheap link to perform some basic tunneling,
administration, and hosting some of our websites, nothing too fancy.  The
servers behind the nightmare satellite link provide RADIUS, Squid, a web
based login system, and some primitive SCADA that we use to monitor the
system.

 

The wall that I am running up against is that this whole issue of caching
dynamic content and browsers that do goofy things like asking for pages to
be served un-cacheable.  It is pretty clear the bookshelf missing the leg on
craiglist that was posted in 2012 is never, ever going to sell, but Chrome
just can't be sure enough I guess.  So, like any good amateur Squid admin I
violate http standards (I know, for shame :)!) and have it cache things for
a few minutes (so you may get shown the same ad twice, so what?).  I have
been pondering things like Riverbed and a bunch of other technologies, but
in the final analysis, they tend to only really work well when you're doing
SAMBA or something else with CRAZY repetition in the datastream and small
byte shifts.  Oh its good voodoo when it works, but it's not really
applicable to the caching the http problem, especially when they want about
3 kidneys, an arm, and firstborn child every year for a license.

 

Then I read the Cache-Digests section, and I *think* it either does
something very cool, or is perhaps a bit of hacking away from doing
something very cool.  So, I thought I'd ask for thoughts.  I am wondering if
it is possible using the existing layout, theoretically possible, or is just
a plain bad idea to use digests to refresh content on the expensive side of
the link.  The idea would go something like this: we'd have a server on the
cheap link, a server at the expensive end of the link, and a VPN type tunnel
between them.  I can tell you from much practice that openVPN and some
compression can get this part done.  We'll call them cheap-server,
expensive-server, and clients.  The layout becomes:

 

<Cheap-Server> ---- Internet --- Satellite ----<Expensive-Server> ---
Clients

 

<Expensive-server> is a transparent proxy using tproxy and exists already.
It has a pretty poor cache rate, mostly because of my ham-handed inability
to write good cache rules, but partly because the content providers in this
world need that jpg that hasn't changed since 2006 to go with "no-cache"
set, (grr ;). 

 

So, here's my theory:  Setup <expensive-server> so that it caches
EVERYTHING, all of it, and catalogs it with this Digest.  It doesn't expire
anything, ever, the only way something gets released from that cache is when
the drive starts running out of room.  It's digest is then sent to
<cheap-server>, which doesn't cache ANYTHING, NOTHING.  When a request comes
through from a client, <Expensive-Server> checks the refresh rules, and if
it isn't too stale it gets served just like it does now, but if it IS
expired, it then asks <Cheap-Server> "hey, how expired is this?" and
<Cheap-Server> (which has all the bandwidth it could ever want) grabs the
content, and digests it.  If the digest for the new retrieval matches
something in the digest sent by <expensive-server>, then <cheap-server>
sends up a message that says "it's still fresh, the content was written by
lazy people or idiots, carry on".

 

As far as I can tell from (very limited) experimenting and reading, this
doesn't *appear* to be how it works, but I may well just have this messed
up.  So, I thought I'd ask, is that the idea, is that possible, plausible,
on the road map, or just plain insane.  I'm not a gifted coder, but in a
pinch I can usually do more good than harm, just wondering if this is worth
digging into.  Curious what your thoughts are on this, thank you!

Subject: [squid-users] Accessing squid from a url rather than proxy settings
Message-ID: <D2545EC9.2341C%phil.allred@snow.edu>

I want to have users access squid directly from a URL like this:

http://my.squidserver.org:3128/testurl

Rather than by setting a proxy in their browser.  Then I want squid to rewrite the URL ?my.squidserver.org?  to the site I want users to access.  The reason I want to do this is in order to access ONLY a certain research database through the proxy server, not all HTTP requests.

When I set up squid to do url rewriting, everything works, if I configure my browser to use my proxy server.  However, when I try to access squid directly  like mentioned above, it refuses to try to rewrite the URL.  Squid just sends back an error like this:


The following error was encountered while trying to retrieve the URL: /testurl

Invalid URL

Some aspect of the requested URL is incorrect.


Is what I?m trying to do even possible?  If so, how do I fix my problem?

Thanks in advance,

Phil

Hi,

so squid is now working again. It was a problem with squidguard and option -s.

Why this all of sudden is a problem, I don?t know. I have some other servers and there everything works without a problem.

Thank you all for your great help :).

Correct. SUSE 11 came with Squid-3.1.

And, SUSE 12 was out with Squid-3.3 a whole year ago tomorrow.

Neither is great by our current standards (3.5), but still miles ahead of 2.7.

Squid is already giving you huge hints:

 "(squidGuard): invalid option -- 's'"



I'm also minded that the only changes anyone has published for squidGuard in the last few years were my release of patches to make it handle Squid-3.2+ helper protocol. Any Squid older than 3.2 will have horrible problems if passed responses from a SG patched with those. They were only ever intended for use to make SG compatible with a Squid upgrade to 3.4+.

Hi,
  a proxy is different from a webserver. The protocol they speak is
slightly different in order to support the use-cases (nothing would
technically prevent from having webservers use a language more similar
to proxies); what you are trying to do is to use Squid (the proxy) as
if it was a webserver, which it isn't.

Here is two parallel blocks of data: sniffing session from proxy box, 
and the same time squid access.log entries:

Note: Also ICQ uses non-visible sessions on transparent proxy box over 
port 5190 in parallel.

Message-ID: <CAMxdDZBQSs5UdFPFMxsE=yNeOy5qLOshGM_X84q1bz-qx+jPeg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Is there any plan to add support for websocket when using intercept mode?

Currently, I use SslPeekAndSplice feature but this brokes many
websites using websocket (one example is web.whatsapp.com). As a
workaround, after peeking at step 1, splicing problematic sites and
bumping the rest works. But maintaining this list is tiring and I
can't use content filtering for these sites. It would be much better
if squid had support for websocket.

Hi Amos,

> You may need to use key_extras feature for now to send the SNI logformat value explicitly in a new key=value field.
Could you give me a hint where I find informations about that ? 
I searched in Wiki and google but only find a possibility to sending key_extras for auth_param,
also if it's possible how / where I could search for the "value" names like "sni-send-from-client".

> Or you could look at making a patch to send the SNI instead of HTTP level "domain" from the CONNECT. Any help getting these annoyances out 
> of the way is very welcome.
Um , todo that I had to understand how it works at the moment and see the code. Could I find it on github ?

Best Regards
Sebastian

Yes. Although to do it easily will require a Squid-3.4 or later where transaction annotations are available. Also a helper that sends back the group=X to Squid about what group(s) the user is in (could be auth helper or external ACL helper).
 So far only the kerberos auth helper does that and it sends the SSID value as the group=X value for all the groups listed in the Kerberos token.

With a helper returning the group names to Squid, a "note" type ACL can be used to check the group=X annotation values in any access control rules. Including delay_access.

That delay pool requires that an external_acl_type helper is being used and sending some tag=X back to Squid to attach 'tag' each request / transaction.

That helper has to be tested on one of the *_access rules where async / slow group lookups will work. The delay_access rules will *not* work since they are a fast-group check. http_access is the usual place and the heper decides both whether to allow use of Squid and what to tag the request with.


You define the pool to be of class 5 with a Bytes/sec rate:
  delay_pools 1 1
  delay_parameters 1 5 20480

You define delay_access to match for the requests that are to have that pools traffic rate limit applied:
  delay_access 1 allow localnet

Squid will automatically arrange so each unique tag=X value the helper assigns to those pooled requests will have a pool. All requests to which the helper replies 'tag=ZZ' will share a one pool, but requests the helper replies with 'tag=YY' will have a different pool. etc.
 Requests not having a tag at all share one pool (I think, havent checked that).

That is it.

The difficult bits are that only one tag= value can be assigned to a transaction, attempts to repeat or alter one assigned wont work, and that detail about the async/slow access lists being the only ones where the helper can be checked.

also if it's possible how / where I could search for the "value" names like "sni-send-from-client".

Um , todo that I had to understand how it works at the moment and see the code. Could I find it on github ?

Not until someone patches Squid to do Range response caching.


Meanwhile I question this "need".

D/L from multiple mirrors and caching the result as one object breaks
future D/L from having the same "need" met. Since the future responses
are served from cache instead of those multiple mirrors.

If it is acceptible for one fetch to be single-soruced. Then why is
there a need for an identical other requets to be multiple servers. It
does not make sense for the "need" to exist.

Seems to me the "need" is actually a "want" and a greedy one at that.


Remember that each browser/client fetching tens of requests. Means a
proxy deals with requests by the thousand. Means an origin is possibly
serving close to millions of endpoints with each response.

Now multiple those numbers by 5...

It is a better and more responsive system that conserves those
upstream/server resources and sends as few requests up as necessary.

Refresh is more efficient than either HIT or MISS. The origin *has* been
contacted, but it said the cached content was still good to be used.

This is HTTP/1.1, not HTTP/1.0.
Squid is a cache, not an archive or buffer.

That is pretty much what offline_mode is designed to do. Cache
everything no matter how stale and serve it while the origin has
possibly gone offline/down for maintenance.

Sqiud is designed to output fresh results. Full stop.

Serving non-fresh results is dangerous unless the origin has explicitly
stated that they may be served.

That is not how HTTP works.

Caching has a fixed algorithm for freshness built into the
specifications.  The origin server is in control of the parameters for
that. It states how long the content is fresh for and what the proxy is
permitted to do with it. Only when it leaves a parameter unstated can
refresh_pattern be used to supply the default value you want.


As I mentioend to Yuri in another thread recently, Ths is very much akin
to liceneing of copyright materials, where the origin is the content
owner and asigning rights to redistributors (proxies). Taking on other
rights that have been explicitly denied is not a good situation.

You just described what HTTP/1.1 revalidation requests do. In your logs
as REFRESH_*. Though they have to send HTTP headers around to get it to
work, which is a little more expensive than the Digest would be, the
result is far more reliable and accurate.


The Cache Digest is just a one-way hash of the URL entries in the cache
index. It is for reducing ICP queries to a peer proxy (ie the frontend
cheap server). If you dont have a cache at both end of the conection it
is not useful. And like ICP it is full of false matches when used with
modern HTTP/1.1.

Note that if you have a separate web server already that the proxy is
just proxying for with that domain name it is called a reverse-proxy
situation.

That is doable and common setup with Squid (ie how most CDN work). But
it does require a separate webserver doing the webserver things.

As you see it has been requested and everyone is just waiting for
somebody else to do it for them for free.
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/AboutSquid#How_to_add_a_new_Squid_feature.2C_enhance.2C_of_fix_something.3F>

To be frank, the upstream developers are more interested in getting
Squid to be more performant and getting HTTP/2 working. We have very
little interest in making Squid become just a slow blind packet relay
for traffic that would be better passed over TCP connections. Which is
what WebSockets is designed to lead to. So the hobbyists are not going
to do it for free any time soon.

Or better, something like this can work?

external_acl_type internetfullthrottle_grp children=20 ttl=3600  negative_ttl=3600 %LOGIN /usr/lib64/squid/ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl -g InternetFullThrottle -D xxx
acl internetfullthrottle external internetfullthrottle_grp

delay_pools 1
delay_class 1 1
delay_parameters 1 1250000/1250000
delay_access 1 allow internetfullthrottle
delay_access 1 deny all

PS: I'm using ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl to assing an internet "profile" to users, using groups in active directory.

Thanks a lot!

Yes. Although to do it easily will require a Squid-3.4 or later where transaction annotations are available. Also a helper that sends back the group=X to Squid about what group(s) the user is in (could be auth helper or external ACL helper).
 So far only the kerberos auth helper does that and it sends the SSID value as the group=X value for all the groups listed in the Kerberos token.

With a helper returning the group names to Squid, a "note" type ACL can be used to check the group=X annotation values in any access control rules. Including delay_access.

That delay pool requires that an external_acl_type helper is being used and sending some tag=X back to Squid to attach 'tag' each request / transaction.

That helper has to be tested on one of the *_access rules where async / slow group lookups will work. The delay_access rules will *not* work since they are a fast-group check. http_access is the usual place and the heper decides both whether to allow use of Squid and what to tag the request with.


You define the pool to be of class 5 with a Bytes/sec rate:
  delay_pools 1 1
  delay_parameters 1 5 20480

You define delay_access to match for the requests that are to have that pools traffic rate limit applied:
  delay_access 1 allow localnet

Squid will automatically arrange so each unique tag=X value the helper assigns to those pooled requests will have a pool. All requests to which the helper replies 'tag=ZZ' will share a one pool, but requests the helper replies with 'tag=YY' will have a different pool. etc.
 Requests not having a tag at all share one pool (I think, havent checked that).

That is it.

The difficult bits are that only one tag= value can be assigned to a transaction, attempts to repeat or alter one assigned wont work, and that detail about the async/slow access lists being the only ones where the helper can be checked.

Hi Tarik,
   as far as I know, no developer is working on that.
The best way to get that feature would be to sponsor a developer to
implement it.

Thanks. We had a spam run that looks like it was from one of the
subscribed user accounts. I believe it is now being garbaged, but still
in the process of confirming that and clearing the mail backlog.

Please feel free to drop anything sent to the list in the last few hrs
which has the subject line is "Fw: new message".

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If I understand well I have to use a "fake" slow acl, to have cached results, and then use in the fast acl delay_access. Thanks

Something like this? http_access allow password internetfull Internetfullthrottle is a "fake" rule because the following http_access allow password internetfull is less restrictive. Is it right?

http_access allow password internetfull Internetfullthrottle
http_access allow password internetfull

external_acl_type internetfullthrottle_grp children=20 ttl=3600
negative_ttl=3600 %LOGIN /usr/lib64/squid/ext_kerberos_ldap_group_acl -g InternetFullThrottle -D xxx

 delay_pools 1
 delay_class 1 1
 delay_parameters 1 1250000/1250000
 delay_access 1 allow internetfullthrottle delay_access 1 deny all

Thanks

If I understand well I have to use a "fake" slow acl, to have cached results, and then use in the fast acl delay_access. Thanks

What I'm hearing is, there are facilities for handling that already, don't crack open digest*.cc anytime soon :)

Thank you Amos, both for the response, and for years of diligent effort.  I have probably read hundreds if not thousands of your responses now, your efforts are appreciated by a quiet mob of people scratching their head in the wilderness.  I have other questions, but they're unrelated, I'll let this thread go.

Hello Jester,

    With a few configuration adjustments and code modifications, you can
make Cache Digests help with your use case. Cache Digests make decisions
based on request URLs. It sounds like you want to make decisions based
on response body as well. It is possible to change the code to do that,
but it will be a lot of non-trivial work and there will always be some
false positives because Cache Digests are not meant to give
always-precise answers.


As Amos mentioned, there are existing/standard HTTP mechanisms that are
meant to decrease pointless fetches across expensive links. However,
just like Cache Digests, "as is", they may not work well in your use
case. Those mechanisms make decisions based on origin-server-supplied
headers such as ETags. As you said, that information may be missing or
false in many responses.

Just like with Cache Digests, with a few configuration adjustments and
code modifications, you can make those standard mechanisms work better
for you. For example, you can teach Squid to generate its own ETag-like
content+header checksums that can be used in conditional HTTP requests
that Squid understands. None of this is easy, but it is doable.


There have been many proposals on how to solve this problem. I do not
think there is a single winning approach. Everybody seem to experiment
with their own tweaks of the existing tools and standards.

If you are looking for a solution that will cost you a few days/weeks of
development and sysadmin work, I do not think there is one. If you are
willing and able to invest a lot more, then I recommend that you
estimate the expected savings _before_ you invest in an expensive
solution. Getting reliable estimates is a complicated project on its
own, but it is still a lot cheaper than investing months into a solution
that does not meet your needs.


HTH,

Alex.

Hello Squid team,

I need your help please. I tried looking in FAQ page but did not find anything related.
What should I do to upgrade from 3.1 to 3.3. I don't want to upgrade to higher version yet.

Do you know where can I have step by step guide or something related.

Based on your description, you do not really need WebSockets support in
Squid. You need a better detection of non-HTTP traffic (combined with
the existing on_unsupported_protocol directive). That is a much smaller
and more welcomed project (although the same FAQ answer referenced by
Amos would apply).

Each version you go to over 3.1 has different SSL-Bump design needed.
Other than that the last major pain was the jump to 3.2 when helper
renaming happened.

Also, We've done a lot more work over the recent series to make
migrating versions a lot less trouble than ever before. So the more
recent you go the less total pain will be involved.


> Do you know where can I have step by step guide or something related.

We dont have a step-by-step guide. How you do it depends on how you
previously installed Squid, what you are using it for, what your
abilities are, etc.

In general;

1) make install the newer version over or alongside the old version, but
don't run it

2) run "squid -k parse" using the new squid binary and fix anything in
squid.conf it labels as FATAL or ERROR. Without these fixed the new
Squid will not run.

3) also fix as many of the warnings and other issues it mentions as you can.

4) start the new proxy, and monitor for a while to see if unexpected
problems appear


If you have a vendor packaging Squid for you the first step is whatever
they require. They should take care of most of the upgrade and you are
just left with making sure the config file is updated. Sometimes they
take care of that too.


As I mentioned above upgrades crossing Squid-3.2 had their helper
binaries renamed. So see the Squid-3.2 release notes for details on what
the new names are. You will need to edit squid.conf for those if nothing
else.
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/RELEASENOTES.html>


If you have the time it is usually a good idea to look over the release
notes of the new versions you are going to and/or skipping over. We have
added a lot of features aimed at making Squid easier to use. You may
find you can simplify your systems somewhat.

Essentially yes. Though the ACL does not have to be fake. It can be the
same lookup that permits the client to make use of the proxy (in
http_access).

Hi Amos,

My client is sending sni. I have checked this. Squid only generates SNI
fake connect at step2 if sslbump action is splice. For all other ssl bump
actions it does not generate fake connect with sni.
Is this a bug or limitation in squid? Do you plan in future to change it?

Thanks

Yes, but only because you are using class 1 pool in that config.

The class 5 pool you asked about earlier would not work with that helper
or delay_access rules.

Its bot a bug exactly. I'm not sure at this point what we will do about
it. Alex adn Christos are apparently doing a bit of redesign of the
process and I'm not sure how that is going or planned to be yet.

Conceptually the fake CONNECT represents the server authority named in
the protocol prior to TLS handshake beginning. Which is TCP and thus the
server-IP from the TCP SYN packet. That has already been accepted though
the http_access permissions in its raw-IP form.

Personally I am leaning more and more towards having Squid simply do the
step-1 peek in all traffic. So access controls and permissions start at
step 2 with SNI going through the http_access rules in the fake CONNECT.

But that would possibly have issues where people want or be required to
terminate or splice without peek happening first. From a security
standpoint it should not matter, but we sill have to verify that.

Thanks.

My problem is the same described in the following link:
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/103313

I can't access a Sharepoint web page using internet explorer it keeps saying "Unable to Login", for example with Chrome I don?t have this issue but IE is the browser I need to use. My proxy service, whitelist, etc., works with no problem.

I took the example of that bulletin so I decided 3.3. I guess higher versions should have that issue fixed.

Also, We've done a lot more work over the recent series to make migrating versions a lot less trouble than ever before. So the more recent you go the less total pain will be involved.


> Do you know where can I have step by step guide or something related.

We dont have a step-by-step guide. How you do it depends on how you previously installed Squid, what you are using it for, what your abilities are, etc.

In general;

1) make install the newer version over or alongside the old version, but don't run it

2) run "squid -k parse" using the new squid binary and fix anything in squid.conf it labels as FATAL or ERROR. Without these fixed the new Squid will not run.

3) also fix as many of the warnings and other issues it mentions as you can.

4) start the new proxy, and monitor for a while to see if unexpected problems appear


If you have a vendor packaging Squid for you the first step is whatever they require. They should take care of most of the upgrade and you are just left with making sure the config file is updated. Sometimes they take care of that too.


As I mentioned above upgrades crossing Squid-3.2 had their helper binaries renamed. So see the Squid-3.2 release notes for details on what the new names are. You will need to edit squid.conf for those if nothing else.
 <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/RELEASENOTES.html>


If you have the time it is usually a good idea to look over the release notes of the new versions you are going to and/or skipping over. We have added a lot of features aimed at making Squid easier to use. You may find you can simplify your systems somewhat.

Ah. Well if you are wanting to keep RHEL support and okay with moving to
RHEL 6 or 7, the Squid 3.3 packages in one of those should be fixed
versions IIRC.

The process to upgrade is then the usual RHEL process. Along with the
manual squid.conf checking afterwards just to be sure.

NP: From recent talks with the RHEL maintainer they are going to provide
squid-3.5 backport packages soon'ish. Though I'm not clear on exactly
what RHEL versions that would be for yet, or the ETA.


Or if you want to move to what RHEL describe there as "the community
version". You can find those packages through:
 <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/RedHat>
(bugs in the installer and packaging are supported by Eliezer, bugs in
the run-time programs by us here).

	craigslist.org images, wacky stuff.
Message-ID: <003601d1111c$b0c21180$12463480$@optimera.us>

So, here is the problem:  I want to cache the images on craigslist.  The
headers all look thoroughly cacheable, some browsers (I'm glairing at you
Chrome) send with this thing that requests that they not be cachable, but
craigslist replies anyway and says "sure thing! Cache that sucker!" and
firefox doesn't even do that.  An example of URL:
http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_3fcu92TR5jB_600x450.jpg

 

The request headers look like:

Host: images.craigslist.org

I started out with a configuration from here:
http://wiki.sebeka.k12.mn.us/web_services:squid_update_cache but have made a
lot of tweaks to it.  In fact, I've dropped all the updates, all the
rewrite, store id, and a lot of other stuff.  I've set cache allow all
(which, I suspect I can simply leave blank, but I don't know)  I've cut it
down quite a bit, the one I am testing right now for example looks like
this:

 

My squid.conf (which has been hacked mercilously trying stuff, admittedly)
looks like this:

There is a good deal of hacking that has gone into this configuration, and I
accept that this will eventually be gutted and replaced with something less,
broken.  Where I am pulling my hair out is trying to figure out why things
are cached and then not cached.  That top refresh line (the one looking for
jpg, gifs etc) has taken many forms, and I am getting inconsistent results.
The above image will cache just fine, a couple times, but if I go back,
clear the cache on the browser, close out, restart and reload, it releases
the link and never again shall it cache.  What is worse, it appears to get
getting worse over time until it isn't really picking up much of anything.
What starts out as a few missed entries piles up into a huge list of cache
misses over time.

 

Right now, I am running somewhere in the 0.1% hits rate, and I can only
assume I have buckled something in all the compile and re-compiles, and
reconfigurations.  What started out as "gee, I wonder if I can cache
updates" has turned into quite the rabbit hole!

 

So, big question, what debug level do I use to see this thing making
decisions on whether to cache, and any tips anyone has about this would be
appreciated.  Thank you!

That?s kind of what I figured.  My thinking is that there is probably a higher fraction of content tags that would match, but it would take some care in calculating a checksum that wasn't in fact larger than the data itself.  But in any event, it seems plausible to me that it is possible.  Sounds like cache digest may be the right spot to start reading.  If I get anything like somewhere, I'll keep you guys in the loop... more importantly, I'll ask a bunch of questions :)

Hello Jester,

    With a few configuration adjustments and code modifications, you can make Cache Digests help with your use case. Cache Digests make decisions based on request URLs. It sounds like you want to make decisions based on response body as well. It is possible to change the code to do that, but it will be a lot of non-trivial work and there will always be some false positives because Cache Digests are not meant to give always-precise answers.


As Amos mentioned, there are existing/standard HTTP mechanisms that are meant to decrease pointless fetches across expensive links. However, just like Cache Digests, "as is", they may not work well in your use case. Those mechanisms make decisions based on origin-server-supplied headers such as ETags. As you said, that information may be missing or false in many responses.

Just like with Cache Digests, with a few configuration adjustments and code modifications, you can make those standard mechanisms work better for you. For example, you can teach Squid to generate its own ETag-like
content+header checksums that can be used in conditional HTTP requests
that Squid understands. None of this is easy, but it is doable.


There have been many proposals on how to solve this problem. I do not think there is a single winning approach. Everybody seem to experiment with their own tweaks of the existing tools and standards.

If you are looking for a solution that will cost you a few days/weeks of development and sysadmin work, I do not think there is one. If you are willing and able to invest a lot more, then I recommend that you estimate the expected savings _before_ you invest in an expensive solution. Getting reliable estimates is a complicated project on its own, but it is still a lot cheaper than investing months into a solution that does not meet your needs.


HTH,

Alex.

"this thing" being what exactly?

I am aware of several nasty things Chrome sends that interfere with
optimal HTTP use. But nothing that directly prohibits caching like you
describe.

Not exactly. It says only that you are *allowed* to store it for 30
days. Does not say you have to.

Your refresh_pattern rules will use that as the 'max' limit along with
the below Date+Last-Modified header values when determining whether the
response can be cached, and for how long.

This is intercepted traffic.

I've run some tests on that domain and it is another one presenting only
1 single IP address on DNS results, but rotating through a whole set in
the background depending on from where it gets queried. As a result
different machines get different results.


What we found just the other day was that domains doing this have big
problems when queried through Google DNS servers. Due to the way Google
DNS servers are spread around the world and load balancing their traffic
these sites can return different IPs on each and very lookup.

The final outcome of all that is when Squid tries to verify the
intercepted traffic was actually going where the client intended, it
cannot confirm the ORIGINAL_DST server IP is one belonging to the Host
header domain.


The solution is to setup a DNS resolver in your network and use that
instead of the Google DNS. You may have to divert clients DNS queries to
it if they try to go to Google DNS still. The result will be much more
cacheable traffic and probably faster DNS as well.

You are missing the default security http_access lines. They should be
re-instated even on intercepted traffic.

 acl SSL_Ports port 443

 http_access deny !Safe_ports
 http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_Ports

Okay, assuming you have the proper iptables/ip6tables TPROXY rules setup

Not useful. That is the default action when "cache" directive is

The above should not be doing anything in current Squid which are
HTTP/1.1 compliant. It is just a directive we have forgotten to remove.

What Squid version is this? 0.1% seems to be extremely low. Even for a

I didn't updated this wiki but the current stable is 3.5.9 for CentOS 7 
and CentOS 6.

For now I am testing 3.5.10 and it seems to work fine else then couple 
specific bugs.

In any case I decided that 3.4.14 will have a release also and I expect 
it to be ready as the free time gives me.

Hi gents.

I think, all of you who use Bump, seen much this messages in your cache.log.

SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert certificate unknown

AFAIK, no way to identify which CA is absent in your setup.

I propose to consider the following questions: how do properly support 
SSL proxy, if you can not identify the problem certificates? Telepaths 
sunbathing in Bali. The procedure, which currently can not quickly and 
in any way to effectively determine such a certificate.

At the moment, the situation is as follows. SSL library - a thing in 
itself, it runs by itself and does not write any logs. Squid - itself 
and any useful information on the library does not receive but obscure 
diagnostic messages. The possibility in any way specify the SSL library 
diagnostic messages we have, and, as I understand it, will not.

So, any ideas?

WBR, Yuri

Make sure Squid is sending the whole CA chain to the remote end?

I think so, "From the remote end". If we have web-server with CA, which 
is not exists on our proxy, we must install it (which means "trust 
them", yea?) in our proxy manually.

I have idiotic idea - Squid fetch remote CA and offer us to trust and 
install interactively. :) This is, of course, clinically idiotism. :)

But - to support real Squid installation with thoursands users, I really 
want to know, which CA's not exists from my side.

Intermediate CA's is no matter - if we have root CA already, fetch 
intermediate chain is not big problem.

In this case, however, we faced unknown root CA exactly.

Yes?

And so what?

Yea, I can kick all users, watch huge access.log, trying to identify 
problem URL row by row, execute curl/wget.

And?

Do this procedure every day?

This is not the best a waste of time.

Of course, the OpenSSL developers have to tear off his hands. But what 
about us, smart and handsome? ;)

Yes, but only because you are using class 1 pool in that config.

The class 5 pool you asked about earlier would not work with that helper or delay_access rules.

That is what the Browsers do. It has been suggested to write a cert
validator that does it too.

I doubt. Chains do not have length limits and IIRC you can't know that
it is a root CA until you actually have it and see that it is
self-signed. At which point it is not "certificate unknown" anymore.

What is missing is just some CA in the chain. It needs to be located
somehow, only then can the decision happen about whether to trust or not
and see if another up the chain is needed too.


> 
> And so what?

So by walking the chain and filling in as needed the cert validator
helper can probably fill the whole sequence in and reach a root CA that
is already trusted and tells you the found ones can be too. That is what
the Browsers do.

Browser do. Bump-enabled proxy is not.

This is significantly limits the possibility of operating SSL bump in a
more or less large installations.

In addition, not every system administrator is able to write any complex
helper in any language. I mean, it seems to me, is to write such and be
included in the proxy. Not a toy demonstrator features. A full-helper,
which, though in a much easier life of the system administrator.

So far I have only heard that such solutions exist - even in a single
instance. But not a single piece of code seen.

Personally, I used the method of Edison - each case I found out manually
find and install the desired one certificate. But this is - not the
solution. I have only a few hundred users. I find it difficult to
determine what the problems will be the system administrator really
large cache - say, 10 thousand users.

Perl/Python/Haskell/Go/C/C++ really cool - but not every geek is
red-weeks to address the CA's problem of productive server.

Hello to everybody and thank you!

By upgrading to squid 3.4.4 thje problem solves!
I think there is something on Squid 3.1.8, in conjunction with Dansguardian, that creates some loops the telnettting          firewall's LAN  ethernet to the 8080 (Dansguardian) port!

I have investigate better about the problem that brings up CPU and Squid process over 100%!
We have this situation: Dansguardian on port 8080 and Squid on port 3128.

The The problem appear when telnetting, from LAN, to:
<ip_firewall_proxy>:8080

Squid process raise up, in few seconds, to 100% and nobody can surf..

I disabled NAT, to make sure it was not a loop of iptables-transparent proxying redirection.

Have you good some suggestions for us?

Thank you again!

It seems to me that all this functionality must be enabled by default in
the SSL proxies. As the base. Do not I have to wrestle with where (and
how) to take intermediate certificates. Or how to define an unknown CA root.

 A proxy.

At a minimum, it should write the information on them in the log - in an
understandable form - that I was not engaged in telepathic guessing and
did not use the method of Edison, turning over hundreds of log records.

The chrome version of the headers have two lines that make my eye twitch:

 Cache-Control: max-age=0
 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

Which (unless I don't understand what's going on, which is quite possible) means "I don't want the response cached, and if possible, could we securely transfer this picture of an old overpriced tractor?  It's military grade intelligence information here that bad guys are trying to steal".  Am I interpreting that wrong?

So getting lazy and using 8.8.8.8 because I don't have to remember which server I installed bind or dnsmasq on has finally come back to haunt me...  I actually had a nightmare of a time getting another system working over the same problem, I'm giving this a rating of highly plausible.  I'll revise the structure, if that fixes the issue, I'll let you know.

The problem with an intermittent issue is that sometimes unrelated changes make it "work", and then later don't, and you end up with some quirky stuff.

That part at least, is working, it gets and caches *some* traffic, just an oddly small amount of it.

I've compiled bleeding edge (squid-3.5.10-20151001-r13933).  I had been using the Ubuntu 14.04 pre-installed library for a while but there were enough things released in 3.4 and 3.5 that I decided to just suck it up and compile it.  Since this is running on a virtual machine anyway, I just reinstalled to keep from having any contamination between packaged squid and compiled squid.

Update on statistics:  In my access log, which ran for a couple hours (it wasn't catching much, but it wasn't breaking anything either, so I let it run), in that time there was about 4.2 GB of traffic, the cache grew to 500MB (which seems probably right actually), but there were only 3050 total HIT/REFRESH entries combined in the access log out of 173,915 lines.  So I'd like to revise that number to 1.7% (the 0.1% was with a nearly empty cache, not a real fair example!).  That still seems pretty low, but is a LOT BETTER than 0.1%!

So, bottom line, I may have cried wolf too soon in some respects (its doing something), but the fact that pretty cacheable looking stuff from craigslist is being dropped makes me think that DNS issue is doing bad things to me.  I'll fix that!

I have used 22,3 which I gleaned from another post on this list, I find a lot of this in my cache.log:

 2015/10/27 18:23:18.402| ctx: enter level  0: 'http://images.craigslist.org/00707_cL1v48AjUBR_300x300.jpg'
2015/10/27 18:23:18.402| 22,3| http.cc(328) cacheableReply: NO because e:=p2XDIV/0x24afa00*3 has been released.
2015/10/27 18:23:18.409| ctx: exit level  0

I'll let you know if fixing DNS takes that out.

Subject: [squid-users] Compiling Squid under Cygwin
Message-ID: <032E6A49D31A26468B71123BE96263AD4B5CD1E8@DELINVMMX021.sig.dom>

Hello all,

I'm trying to compile Squid 3.5.10 for Windows with Cygwin, and ran into number of problems. Some I was able to resolve, but finally stuck at compiling negotiate_sspi_auth helper. In particular, I get "error: 'SSP_blobP' was not declared in this scope" in negotiate_sspi_auth.cc. The only place I've found where SSP_blobP type is defined is sspwin32.h, and it is defined only if _SQUID_WINDOWS_ macro is also defined:

#if _SQUID_WINDOWS_
...
typedef char * SSP_blobP;
...
#endif /* _SQUID_WINDOWS_ */

But _SQUID_WINDOWS_, which may be defined in osdetect.h, is not defined if we are on Cygwin:

#elif defined(__CYGWIN__)
#define _SQUID_CYGWIN_ 1

#elif defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__MINGW__)
#define _SQUID_MINGW_ 1
#define _SQUID_WINDOWS_ 1

#elif defined(WIN32) || defined(WINNT) || defined(__WIN32__) || defined(__WIN32)
#define _SQUID_WINDOWS_ 1

Since on Cygwin macro __CYGWIN__ is defined, then only _SQUID_CYGWIN_ becomes defined, but _SQUID_WINDOWS_ is not. There are places in Squid code which are processed only when both _SQUID_CYGWIN_ and _SQUID_WINDOWS_ are defined, so as an experiment I've tried patching osdetect.h to make _SQUID_WINDOWS_ also defined when compiling on Cygwin, but that immediately produced hell of new errors during make: unresolved references, conflicting function declarations, etc.

So does anybody has an idea, how that should be corrected?

Best regards,
Vadim Yakovlev

Well that (debug_options 85,3 22,3) worked like a charm!  I had the info I needed in about two seconds flat!

I am getting:

2015/10/28 09:16:54.075| 85,3| client_side_request.cc(532) hostHeaderIpVerify: FAIL: validate IP 208.82.238.226:80 possible from Host:

Based on http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery I believe this is saying the IP address requested and the one Squid found are not the same.  Bottom line, I think it is time for me to host a DNS server, that way at least the request IP and the squid IP will be more consistent.  It looks like this won't actually completely fix the issue, it is just a problem with transparent proxies.  Time to read up on autoconfiguration of proxies it appears.

Thank you again!

There are places in Squid code which are processed only when both _SQUID_CYGWIN_ and _SQUID_WINDOWS_ are defined, so as an experiment I've tried patching osdetect.h to make _SQUID_WINDOWS_ also defined when compiling on Cygwin, but that immediately produced hell of new errors during make: unresolved references, conflicting function declarations, etc.

It is correct. CygWin presents a POSIX API for code and builds the same
as what a Unix/LinuxBSD build does.

The SSPI helpers are only for Native Windows API builds done with Visual
Studio and maybe MinGW. Neither of which are working yet.


PS. Windows packages are available from Diladele if you just want the
latest version.

max-age=0 from client means "dont use whatever you have cached. Always
go to the server for new content.".
The rest you got.

Are you using the reload or refresh button in your testing? that is
expected to cause that max-age value.

If it is just sending that all the time anyway we will need to update
our hacks.

Introducing auto-configuration :-)

You don't have to configure Squid with dns_nameservers at all these
days. If you omit it entirely Squid will load the systems resolv.conf
and use whatever resolver(s) are in there.

Refresh button, so that at least makes sense.

The problem was that the /etc/resolv.conf was also pointing to different name-servers for my squid cache than the clients were.  Once I gave them all the same name server, everything else fell into step, and I discovered that because... read on

So, after I read your first reply, I responded with a quick snippet of log file that came from the logging level 85,3, it looked like:

"""QUOTEING ANOTHER EMAIL"""
2015/10/28 09:16:54.075| 85,3| client_side_request.cc(532) hostHeaderIpVerify: FAIL: validate IP 208.82.238.226:80 possible from Host:
2015/10/28 09:16:54.075| 85,3| client_side_request.cc(543) hostHeaderVerifyFailed: SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected on local=208.82.238.226:80 remote=192.168.2.56 FD 20 flags=17 (local IP does not match any domain IP) on URL: http://seattle.craigslist.org/favicon.ico
""" END QUOTE """

Based on my reading of http://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery it appears this is actually intended behavior.  That also explains why it is being released and was found non-cacheable.

So, I just installed dnsmasq on two of my servers, pointed my clients toward that address, and so far it is working a whoel lot better.  My hit rate is up in the 10% range, and that is with a nearly empty cache, so that may be the trick.  I only made the change about a short time ago.  More importantly, that error in the log has gone away and I am getting consistent caching behavior, so that is huge.

Thank you!

Hey Jester,

I know that installing bind would probably not be much of a trouble and 
I recommend to use it instead of using dnsmasq.
It will do everything much better even if you are using it as a 
forwarder and not a recursive DNS service.

My hit rate is up in the 10% range, and that is with a nearly empty cache, so that may be the trick.  I only made the change about a short time ago.  More importantly, that error in the log has gone away and I am getting consistent caching behavior, so that is huge.

If you are right, then this could be related to bug 4305 then (if you
ignore all the noise there):

  http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4305

FWIW, Factory is working on implementing automatic certificate fetching
feature. That is a huge feature but we are making good progress.
Meanwhile, there is a simpler patch posted to that bug report that helps
manage this problem (but does not solve it).


HTH,

Alex.

I suspect everybody agrees with that statement. I am sure this will be
implemented eventually. No need to argue about that.

Subject: [squid-users] 3.5.8 Arm7 socket permissions
Message-ID: <5631493F.20908@gmail.com>

Hi all

I have built squid 3.5.8 with yocto to run on an arm 7.

This build of the OS seems to have different permissions for processes 
opening sockets. THe DNS routine fails to open a socket with the 
following error

root at test:~# 2015/10/28 22:07:43 testing| Starting Squid Cache version 
3.5.8 for arm-poky-linux-gnueabi...
2015/10/28 22:07:43 kid1| Service Name: squid
2015/10/28 22:07:43 kid1| comm_open: socket failure: (13) Permission denied
2015/10/28 22:07:43 kid1| comm_open: socket failure: (13) Permission denied
FATAL: Could not create a DNS socket

It looks like I would have to either run squid as a user that can do 
this or change this underlying permissions setting in the OS.

I would rather fix the OS rather than run squid as root.

Has anyone experienced this before and found a fix

thanks in advance

Darren B.

Subject: [squid-users] "NF getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST)" filling cache.log
	due to AWS ELB healthchecks
Message-ID: <CAEKmLn8DLqF9u6-Xnr6aTqWkSMTnAufyiWh=j=70gXKOyG1HwQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I have a working(?) squid 3.10 proxy configuration.
squid-3.1.10-29.18.amzn1.x86_64 on AWS Linux behind an AWS elastic load
balancer.

My problem is that it appears every single AWS elastic load balancer
healthcheck triggers a line like this in cache.log:
2015/10/28 22:35:10| IpIntercept.cc(137) NetfilterInterception:  NF
getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST) failed on FD 14: (92) Protocol not available

I have determined that if I removed the 'intercept' option from our
http_port 3128, we no longer get the warning messages in cache.log, but
squid also no longer functions as we want it to...

How do we resolve this?'
Thanks!

Hey John,

I am pretty sure it is something in the AWS Linux kernel.

In any case you should have some http_port without intercept in the config.
As an example add "http_port 127.0.0.1:13333" but I am not sure how it 
was on squid 3.1.10, I know it is mandatory since for 3.4.

If you can test the same settings on an Ubuntu 14.04 server and not AWS 
Linux it would help much to make sure it's either an AWS Linux specific 
issue or something else.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Hi Eliezer,

I've tried adding a non-intercept line to my squid.conf but it didn't seem
to make a difference.

I've tailed the cache log and run tcpdump on port 3128 on the machine at
the same time to confirm that aws load balancer health checks are what's
causing the getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST) to appear in the logs.  An AWS load
balancer sends tcp packets regularly (configurable, typically several times
a minute from each of several IP addresses) to each host in the load
balancer to ensure that the squid service is up and running.  The squid
service sees these random tcp packets, doesn't know what to do with them,
and logs the getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST) error.

I assume other load balancers do something similar to monitor whether the
service is running on an instance.
Perhaps the real question is 'how do you put squid behind a load balancer
that performs tcp health checks without filling the logs?"

Thanks,
John

Hey,

I got it all wrong.
You cannot run TCP health test on an intercept port..
An intercept port is expected to not receive Direct TCP connections.
What you see is because squid tries to find information on INTERCEPTED 
connection which the case it is not.
If you want to run a health test on the port you should do it with a trick.
You can try to send a TCP connection to an ip of the squid but on 
another port such as 13333 and on the squid iptables add a special rules 
that will redirect any traffic to port 13333 to port 3128.
I do still recommend you to add an addition http_port for local usage 
and statistics availability.

Since you do want to verify that the proxy is running it is not 
mandatory to monitor the 3128 port and you can use another port of the 
proxy which is not an intercept port.
It is expected that the two ports would be always available at the same 
time and each can reflect the status of the service.

Let me know how it works.

Hi Eliezer,

I've added a single line to my squid.conf:
http_port 3130

And I've modified my AWS ELB healthcheck to monitor port 3130 instead of
3128.
Now my instances are still in the ELB, and the proxy still works as
expected, AND the amount of garbage errors in the cache.log has been
significantly reduced.

Unfortunately I'm seeing a single a single line in cache.log every time I
hit the proxy on port 3128:
2015/10/28 23:53:32| IpIntercept.cc(137) NetfilterInterception:  NF
getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST) failed on FD 61: (92) Protocol not available

>From other posts, it appears this warning message related to NAT.  I'm not
doing NAT on the squid proxies, the load balancer takes care of that.

Any ideas how to remove the rest of the noise from my logs?

Thanks again for the help!

It looks like there?s certain hosts that are designed to load balance (or something) between a few IPs, regardless of geography.

For example pbs.twimg.com resolves to wildcard.twimg.com which returns two different IPs each time, from a pool of 5?6, at random. Basically rolling the dice whether the client and the proxy are going to get the same IPs at the same time.

What is one to do about that?

Why are you using an intercept port?
IF you don't need it you dont't.
Every time any direct conneciton is done to the proxy port 3128 it will 
show this line since the connection is a regular TCP one while the 
"intercept" directive instructs squid to fetch information which exists 
only on NATTED\REDIRECT traffic.
Pretty simple and straight forward and this is the way squid works..
You should verify if you need a http_port 1111 or http_port 1111 accel 
or http_port 1111 intercept.

I will be glad to help you in about 20 hours.

Probably a good idea there, I have not used bind in a very, very long time, but I will give it a shot.  

I am still having some issues, but at least now they're all within the bounds of consistent and "what-i-expect" behavior, I just need to think through how to outsmart a couple issues.  The big one now is that many addresses appears to change by the time it the system downloads a particularly large file (Windows updates, to be specific), so it ends up releasing it almost immediately (because of the header spoofing prevention I was talking about in this chain), which is only frustrating because caching big updates would be a huge gain for us.  So far, out of 20 GB transferred, about 6-gb has been windows/apple updates, and that from several hosts.  I'll see if I can get BIND to grab that and cache that resolution a little longer, and hang on to it, but my bigger question is:  if I setup a parent proxy that ONLY grabs the big updates down on my big-fast-cheap connection, then set my little-slow-expensive-connection up to pull from that connection, would that have a higher chance of success?  Since the proxy on the slow system is requesting the same object, I'm wondering if that may work out better.  Not sure that will have the desired effect, but I'm going to try it out, I'll let you know how that works out.

The same thing. Ensuring that the proxy and the clients are using the
same DNS server.

The reasoning goes like so:
* some client does a DNS fetch causing the result to be cached in *that*
server.
* then the proxy repeats the query and gets the DNS cached result.
* those results should match 99% of the time even if the domain DNS is
playing tricks.

This falls down with the Google DNS because "8.8.8.8" is not one server
but an entire farm of servers spread aroudn the globe. The two
consecutive queries done often go to different physical servers.

You can of course configure 8.8.8.8 to be an upstream resolver for your
local DNS server if you think that is a good idea. The key think is
having the same local-end DNS cache being used by the clients and Squid.


NP: these problems do not exist for forward proxies. Only for traffic
hijacking interceptor proxies.

The Host header verification happens as the first step of message
processing before anything else. So it should not be the cause, but a
side effect of something else.

I think a worse problem is if the DNS TTL is shorter than a client
connections TCP connected time. Then requests arriving after the DNS TTL
expired would no longer match the initial dst-IP.

As a workaround you could try to reduce the client_idle_pconn_timeout
(2mins) then if that does not help the client_lifetime (24hrs).

It will probably require patching to get a full fix. I've started
thinking of solutions. Maybe remembering Host names used on the
connection, or closing it ASAP after the DNS TTL runs out.

I dont quite grok that sorry. Can you diagram what you are thinking?

With a front-end proxy you would start to see revalidation requests
happening between the proxies. Due to many origin servers still sending
out new content even if it has not changed, this setup can result in
small bandwidth savings just by existing. The main gain is helping to
optimize the traffic bandwidth and reducing TCP connection count over
long connections like satellite links, where the target is optimal g the
bandwidth behaviour (reducing it is just part of that).

If the frontend has a bigger cache than the backend you will see churn
and extra bandwidth consumption as repeats get served from the frontend
cache. But the origin traffic upstream of it will stay low. This is good
if the internal links are fast and upstream is slow. Like most LAN
situations. It is usually best to have a cache on the client side of a
choke point (slow connection).

They are not garbage. They are telling you very clearly that the message

Exactly. You told Squid it had to do NAT with the "intercept" option.
When it tried to do as you instructed ... boom.

Start with removing the "intercept". It is clearly the wrong thing to
have. Then move on to whatever problem appears next.

If you let us know what this ELB+Squid pair is supposed to be doing,
and/or share your squid.conf we can perhapse suggest what else you need
to do for other problems.

Firstly, since this is Linux ensure you are building Squid with libcap2
support. Squid actually uses capabilities when possible.


Secondly, *Starting* Squid as root does not mean it stays that way.

Squid is actually a pair of processes, one daemon manager and a daemon.
You need to start the main "squid" binary as root so the daemon manager
can do the root things before it drops down to a low-privilege account
for the regular operations.

That low-privilege account is set by whichever of these is found first
(in this order):
* the value in squid.conf cache_effective_user
* the username X specified in --with-default-user=X
* upstream default: "nobody"

This is happening when my client and proxy are using the same DNS server. In this case, a local OS X Server which forwards to my ISP?s DNS servers.

As far as I can tell Google?s DNS isn?t in the equation any more. Even so, if I run a `dig watch` on the domain, it happily cycles through a pool of IPs apparently at random.

Hi

Thanks for the reply.

Libcap2 is in the build, but the build is for an Arm7 and the rootfs is 
read only. Anything that needs write access I have moved to a ram disk
and symlinked it back into the expected place during the build process.

There must be something else in the OS standing in the way.

The unit has dnsmasq on it and that's working just fine. It also has a 
set of iptables rules that have been tested on an X86 system and work fine.

I can see the run it as root idea is just wrong so that's off the table.

Hi,

I am testing Dynamic SSL Certificate Generation:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/DynamicSslCert

My clients are mostly Microsoft Windows Active Directory domain
members. I can push self-signed root ca certificate to clients by means
of group policy in order for browsers not to warn about untrusted

my AD-integrated CA which is automatically trusted by domain member
computers.

If anyone has some experience with this please share.

Hi,

We're having issues with multiple websites going through our Squid
proxy.  The issues only started to occur when we upgraded from Squid
3.1.8 to 3.5.2.

[Details]
1 - When running a speed test from speedtest.net, it fails when it
get's to the Upload test

2 - Logs show the following:
TCP_MISS_ABORTED 000 0 POST
http://speedtest.lon02.softlayer.com/speedtest/speedtest/upload.php?x=0.8349714460782707
FIRSTUP_PARENT/SAML_Pri_Cluster-A

3 - I've gone directly through the firewall (by-passing Squid) and it
work fine.  it's only when we're going through our Squid proxy we see
this issue.

4 - Works fine when we were using Squid 3.1.8

5 - I have tried using Chrome, Firefox and IE

I've tried several different config options in Squid.conf, but no luck.
example.:
dns_v4_first on
maximum_object_size 32 MB
client_request_buffer_max_size 10240 KB

Has anyone faced this issue or give me some tips?

Regards,
Sunny

Subject: [squid-users] Carp example on Debian
References: <1057119608.1329958.1446118829932.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1057119608.1329958.1446118829932.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Trying to run the carp example on Debian this time. The machine is testing with is an i5 with 8Gb of RAM and a 320Gb HDD. I'm getting the following errors in the frontend.cache.log when I try to access a site. Which debug flags should I try? It looks to me like a permissions issue, but I'm not sure what to look for.


Cheers,
MarkJ

Hello, 

I'm trying the latest Jessie + Squid 3.5.10 and there is something wrong with ldap
Of course the package libldap2.dev is present and no problem with the same options and Debian Wheezy 

I missed something ?

Okay. Its just tying to open a bog-standard UDP listener port there. So
no special permissions should be needed.

"debug_options 78,2" should log what IP:port it is trying to listen on
just prior to the failure.

Can you please try with the current 3.5.10 snaphot and see if the

Did you run "apt-get build-dep squid3" first?

There seem to be quite a few things missing in the build environment
from that bit of configure output.

Subject: [squid-users] Cannot access outlook!
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP28CA8EF9E64D99EDA9CF6E9E200@phx.gbl>

Hi everybody. I have a huge problem: I cannot access outlook using the 
browser. I am using squid3.5 over a Debian 8 that . Outlook is the only 
website that causes problems.
I tried rebuild the cach?, load extra rules in the firewall (the hosts 
that not use squid can access outlook)...
Here is mi squid.conf http://pastebin.com/UD784Egu
After login, the browser stops loading, if I refresh the page it takes 
me back to the login page with a "invalid user/pass" error. Also, when 
it tries to connect, after a minutes, i get a "connection reset by peer" 
error. If i use IE, it seems that the connection dies when tries to show 
me my inbox.

Any help will be appreciated. Sorry for my english.

Hi Amos and Eliezer,

My complete squid.conf is in the first post.  The 'interesting' parts are
here:

acl httpacl port 80
acl SSL_ports port 443

http_port 3128 intercept

cache_peer l2proxy  parent 80 0 no-query no-digest name=http_peer
cache_peer_access http_peer allow httpacl
cache_peer l2proxy parent 3129 0 no-query no-digest name=https_peer
cache_peer_access https_peer deny httpacl
never_direct allow all

We have 2 layers of proxies for business reasons.
The proxies in question are the first layer, they redirect all traffic to a
second layer of proxies - l2proxy above
http traffic goes out port 80, https traffic goes out port 3129, toward the
second layer of proxies.
I assume the 'intercept' is what allows / forces the incoming traffic from
3128 to go on to the 2nd layer of proxies.
When I remove 'intercept', the second layer of proxies never get called as
we need them to be.

We don't need squid to do NAT, but we do need it to forward to the second
layer of proxies.
Things are now working as expected, I'm just trying to reduce the noise in
the logs and would clearly welcome any suggestions for improvements.

Thanks again,
John

Hi Cheikhou,

sounds like wrong access right for the .pid file, the default is /usr/local/squid/var/run/${service_name}.pid , 
if you can't find it there have a look in your squid.conf maybe you set it to another location.

Maybe I?m wrong but your PID file should be accessible from user squid because its running under squid.

Sebastian

Hi Amos,

I've compiled Squid 3.5.10 and it's working now.  I wonder what was
causing it in 3.5.2?

For intercepted connections, Squid should, with an admin permission,
connect to the intended IP address without validating whether that IP
address matches the domain name (and without any side effects of such
validation). In interception mode, the proxy should be as "invisible"
(or as "invasive") as the admin wants it to be IMO -- all validations
and protections should be optional. We could still enable them by
default, of course.

SslBumped CONNECT-to-IP tunnels are essentially intercepted connections
as well, even if they are using forwarding (not intercepting) http_ports.

Alex.

Dear Cheikhou,

1. Please don?t reply to me direct , answer to the list.

2. Could you post the owner, group and access rights of the .pid file (like with the command ls -l) ?

The list of suspects is quite long I'm afraid. The dev team has had a
very busy year.

I'm just glad its not still around and adding to the workload :-)

Hey John,

You are 100% doing something wrong!
 From your description and squid.conf there is still something unclear 
to me.
How do the first layer of proxies send their request to the second layer 
of proxies?
If it uses a routing method it's one thing and if it's just splicing the 
traffic to the 3128 port it's another.
Also it will be different if the first layer of proxies know that they 
are talking to a proxy server or they just balance around the connections.
Sorry to tell you what you might already know that you are missing 
couple fundamentals on how things actually work in order to make it work 
as it is suppose to.

In any case I think your scenario doesn't require you to use intercept 
and you should remove it.
The fact that it "works" for you this way is probably a result of a very 
special scenario from the squid proxy point of view.

I do not know what you are balancing there an I do like squid but if you 
need to just splice the connections from the LB to the second layer of 
proxies, why do you actually need squid? what do you benefit from squid 
in this picture? just load balance to the proxy directly.
If you do have an issue when you do not have the intercept flag you 
should start there and start with the access.log to understand what you 
need... and don't play with it.
*If you don't do NAT\REDIRECT on the proxy machine you don't need intercept*

By the way, have you tried haproxy instead of squid? I think it will 
might be better suited for this specific issue.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Hey,

I was wondering about the details on how to install these unstable packages.
It was not mentioned in the squid wiki and I would be happy to add the 
details into it.

Thanks,
Eliezer

I am publishing RPMs for CentOS which should work on RHEL.
Until now I have tested 3.5.10 to be stable but have found couple bugs 
to be affecting some requests performance.
I will publish the 3.5.11 RPMs instead of 3.5.10 if you are interested 
in RPMs rather then self compiling it.

the "admin permission" is the key qestion here.  There's possible problem
where the malicious client can connect to malicious server, ask for any
server name and the malicious content could get cached by squid as a proper
response.

I guess most of admins do intercepting to avoid client configuration, not to
hide the proxies.

Agreed. And understanding of what giving that permission implies!

Very true, provided that Squid trusts the unverified domain name to do
caching. Squid does not have to do that. As Amos have noted, there are
smart ways to minimize most of these problems, but they require more
development work.

IMHO, it is important to establish the "do no harm" principle first and
then use that to guide our development efforts. Unfortunately, some of
the validation code was introduced under different principles, and we
may still be debating what "harm" really means in this context while
adjusting that code to meet varying admin needs.

There should be a sbin/squid daemon manager process on that list at the
top. It may have been killed by something else.

You might have to "kill -9 4711" then erase the .pid file and restart Squid.


It would be best if you could upgrade to a more current Squid version.
3.1 is quite ancient.

Hi Eliezer,

It is entirely possible that haproxy is a better solution than squid for
what we are doing.
I have never used either solution, and inherited this 'working' squid
configuration with the task of cleaning things up and stabilizing it.
Regarding your question of 'How do the first layer of proxies send their
request to the second layer of proxies?', all I can tell you is that all
the work is done in the squid.conf, and I've posted the entire contents
with a few replacements for security reasons.
As I've said, I've removed the word 'intercept' several times and the
requests to secondary proxies no longer work.
I just confirmed this behaviour again.
If this is as 'quiet' as I can make the logs then it is what it is.

Thanks!

Subject: [squid-users] Strange Interaction between Squid and Facebook
Message-ID: <CAOZxD++frknTxoDOUEVjgf7rktO_5_hs2dAFoDp+uu0v5F0FOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm really at my wits' end and
am completely out of ideas as to how I might fix this or why this is
happening.

Background and Architecture:
We are using Squid as our user internet access proxy, it is performing
authentication via LDAP if a site other than what is on the allowed list of
domains is accessed. We are running the proxy at our secondary datacenter
and routing all user internet traffic out through the links on that end, so
that user traffic does not "conflict" with our main website traffic at our
primary datacenter, as we don't yet have separate circuits for each type of
traffic. We have hundreds of users accessing the proxy on a daily basis.
We were running squid 3.3.12 on Solaris 10 11/06 SPARC, with a fairly basic
configuration, I can provide it if necessary, but everything was working
"fine" as far as we were able to tell (no complaints from the users). The
only problem was that the physical hardware is very old and needed to be
retired, as well as being a box we couldn't easily add more resources to.

So I set up a new proxy, running Centos 7.1 x86_64 on a VM (in VMware ESXi)
with the latest Squid release (3.5.10) built from source, with a
configuration along the lines of
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/SmpCarpCluster. We moved to a VM
so we would have greater flexibility and be able to add more resources
easily if the server became stressed.
It worked very well in our testing, and there were no real issues that we
were able to see, so we rolled it out to replace the old proxy.

Since then, everything has been working fine, apart from one site,
Facebook, not loading correctly. It varies based on the particular browser
accessing it, but some/most of the style sheets or content don't appear to
load correctly, resulting in a very mangled look. Running the developer
tools for each respective browser give us information that the connections
to the stylesheets or content are aborted. Most of this content is hosted
on fbcdn.net, which we've made sure is on our allowed domains list.
What is interesting is that the first object (or multiple ones) is
retrieved successfully through the proxy, but subsequent ones are denied.
Again, this appears to vary depending on browser/os combinations, with
Chrome on OSX and IE (on Windows) seeming to work the best.

We are NOT running a Tproxy or any other sort of intercepting proxy, all
the clients are explicitly aware of the proxy's existence through a .pac
configuration file pushed out through Group Policy.

I've tried disabling ssl_bump (which shouldn't be enabled anyway) for the
facebook domains, setting cache deny for those domains, and setting always
direct for those domains, none of which has had any effect.

I've also tried reverting to a more "simple" config, even the exact config
that we were using on the "old" Squid that was working on Solaris, but that
too fails. I've also changed from using Squid 3.5.10 to the version
packaged by CentOS (squid-3.3.8-12.el7_0.x86_64), tried this with both
configurations to no avail.

The only thing that has worked is setting up a "test" squid at our primary
datacenter, same configurations, but this one does work. We've checked and
verified that there are no custom routes or any other network
configurations that vary between the servers, only IP addresses. Both are
on unrestricted vlans that allow direct access to the internet. We are
checking with our networking team to see if there is any custom routing
that is in place on their end, but it's very doubtful that is the case.

I believe I've covered everything here, I can provide any other information
or configurations if necessary (I didn't provide those here because of the
length already). If anyone out there has encountered this issue, I would
GREATLY appreciate any information or troubleshooting assistance you could
provide.

Ah, they are the names of the Debian repositories "Unstable" or "Sid"
and "Testing" or "Stretch" (currently).

What do you think needs adding?

John,

The fact that intercept is changing that seems to be a very specific bug.
You should remove it and find the 'correct' way to make it work.

Instructions on what to add into the sources.list.
I know I have used one of these in the past on some machine but I am 
unable to find how to.
I have tried to look at the wiki as the first step and I have found it 
mentioned with the url for the bugzilla but not one word on what to add 
into the debian installation.

Thanks,

The LB is the first layer.
Squid is the second layer.
The cache_peer Squid is relaying on to are a third.


The hierarchy is thus:

  clients --(?1?)--> LB --(?2?)--> Squid --(HTTP)--> peer(s)

The "?1?" and "?2" parts are what we need to figure out.

How are the clients messages getting to the LB?

a) is it published in DNS as the host of some domain and clients making
requests directly from it that need to be serviced by the proxies you
are wrangling with?

b) are the clients outboung traffic being intercepted/diverted in their
travels to some other server and sent through the LB instead?


How is the load blancer then relying the TCP connections and HTTP
messages inside them to Squid?

A) Is it using NAT to change both dst-IP and dst-port on the TCP packets?

B) Is it terminating the TCP connection from clients, opening one  to
Squid and relaying the HTTP inside based on URL hostnames etc. ?

C) Is it opening a L2 tunnel and relaying the TCP packets to the Squid
machine ?

"getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST) failed ...: (92) Protocol not available"

Should never happen in a working proxy. Ever.

It can appear because a) the NAT tables in the Squid machine kernel are
overflowing, or b) the external network is configured in a broken way.
Both are really bad scenarios. Your are having the (b) problem.

I would not recommend the backporting. There are GCC-5 toolchain changes
that are quite huge in Testing. We also added a squid3/squid package
name transition in Squid itself.

So the things that a backport like that will pull as dependencies may
blow up into a change almost as big as a full system upgrade to Testing.

3.5 will apparently build okay on Jesse though if you follow the compile
instructions in the Squid wiki page. So the self-compile is probably better.

Hey John,

You and me are missing couple things in the picture and you first need 
to understand what you have in order to fix it.
The http_port 3128 intercept cannot and should not handle CONNECT 
request which are the basic form of HTTPS connections that squid knows 
in general how to use.
I am confused which proxies are there and which aren't.
You wrote "My problem is that it appears every single AWS elastic load 
balancer healthcheck triggers a line like this in cache.log:" which 
means that there are couple AWS elastic load balancers.
It kind of confuses me if the squid is the first load balancer or you 
are using some service that AWS sells.
If you are using AWS elastic load balancer which is a service you should 
first make sure you understand what it does exactly and what I am 
talking about is, what is it doing with the packets it receives? Also on 
what level do they work? in the TCP level? in the HTTP level?
Also there are couple missing parts about the squid service itself.
What is to be expected(from a protocol level) from squid to handle?
What HTTP requests should be pointed there? a specific domain? a whole 
bunch of domains? intercepted traffic? do we expect SSL connections to 
be present there?
Do the AWS elastic load balancer handles SSL?

I would describe you the question you are asking in a creative way:
"I have a monkey which eats the banana and every time he is pooping 
after it, I do not understand why he is pooping?"

My and others side of the picture is that you have something that does 
something but cannot is not being described.
Believe me that proxies work the same way for a very long time and your 
setup is probably not that special.
If I understand right the AWS elastic load balancer is something like 
haproxy and from an unknown reason you are using squid in the picture.
Maybe it's for caching maybe it's for network policy or logging.

If you prefer to send me a private email with couple more details and 
the answers to my questions feel free to do that, not everything should 
be publicly available in the mailing list.

I do not know about your TCP and HTTP\HTTPS level of expertise and it 
makes it hard to even know if I am asking you the right questions.
Also do you have someone to ask about any of the system parts? if not... 
TCPDUMP+wireshark is your friend!

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Are these https:// traffic arriving to the proxy in the form of CONNECT
requests?

Or regular http:// URLs arriving as GET method?

Is a POST or PUT method request involved with the fetch or just prior?

Is there an unusual port being used?

Or an OPTIONS request happening for some reason?

Nod. As long as you do not use "ssl-bump" on any http_port or https_port
bumping will not happen.

I'm also a bit suspicious in these situations that it might have
something to do with the network IP-range the clients are on vs the
uplink being used.

Is it breaking only when Squid is in the "other" datacenter from the
client(s) ?

Is one datacenter IPv6-enabled but not the other ?


You could possibly set "debug_options ALL,0 17,4" to track the Squid
outbound message forwarding and see what appears to be going on when it
is connecting out for that domain.

The outbound traffic from the L1proxy instance in question connects to a
public IP / DNS name of an ELB in another AWS region.
We need to send some traffic to a different AWS region, thus the mess below:

AWS instances (clients) ->
AWS internal ELB for L1 proxies -> AWS L1 proxy instances ->
a different AWS internal ELB for  L1 proxy cluster -> a different AWS L1
proxy instance (this is where we have the problem is with 'intercept or
transparent) ->
*One AWS region above, a different AWS region below*
AWS external (publicly addressable) ELB for L2 proxies in a different AWS
region -> AWS L2 proxy instances -> the Internet

These AWS instances have both internal IPs and public IPs, and they don't
really know about their own public IPs.  That may be part or all of the
confusion.

AWS ELBs are published as DNS names, they have multiple IPs, and we are
using DNS to connect to them.

I'm not exactly certain how the ELB functions, at least I don't know enough
to answer your question.
The healthcheck and listeners are are TCP, not HTTP.

Hey Patrick,

Choosing CentOS 7.1 is a great choice.
First thing is to let you know I am packaging squid RPMs for CentOS 7 
and since the next version of squid(3.5.11) will be out in a few days it 
will be published later next month.

About the issue itself.
Couple questions?
Are you running\using ssl-bump or not?
When a client request is being aborted what do you see in the squid 
access.log?
 From what I know facebook works in HTTPS and an abort can be mainly 
because of a network issue or application level issue.
Since I am working with squid 3.5.10 and I do not have this issue with 
ssl-bump ON or OFF it is unclear what is causing the issue.

I couldn't understand how you ran the tests.
I do understand that you have two proxies and one is peering to the 
other, right?

Thanks,
Eliezer

Thanks,

But it will be sure nice to have a way to package specially built for 
12.04 and 14.04 which will not result in a whole dependency fetch.

as it tries to then open the ipv6 port first. but still fails.

I can't see a port number, just the IP address. I am guessing now I may 
have missed something out of the kernel, but everything else seems to 
work, including Nginx on the same machine.

thanks again

Amos,

Thanks for the reply, I apologize if this doesn't come through correctly as
gmail doesn't seem to be parsing the list emails properly.

Are these https:// traffic arriving to the proxy in the form of CONNECT

It looks like the vast majority of the requests are arriving as CONNECT
requests, looking like the traffic is already https, I don't see any POST,
PUT or OPTIONS appearing in the logs.

I'm also a bit suspicious in these situations that it might have

We haven't tried a large scale test of the proxy from the working
datacenter, that is an option. The outbound IP will be different from
each datacenter, but I can drive out to the other location and see if
that makes a difference accessing it from the other direction. Neither
datacenter has IPv6 turned on.

You could possibly set "debug_options ALL,0 17,4" to track the Squid

I'll check that option out as well and see if I get any more usable information.


Thanks for the response!

Greetings,

I am working on setting up Squid 3 to authenticate from Active directory by using the instructions found http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Authenticate/WindowsActiveDirectory and http://wiki.bitbinary.com/index.php/Active_Directory_Integrated_Squid_Proxy and have had success until I reach the section for configuring Squid.  In the instructions found in the second link, there is a test for testing squid_ldap_group.

squid_ldap_group testing
Add testing section here for squid_ldap_group - Thanks Robert. e.g.
/usr/lib/squid3/squid_ldap_group -R -K -S -b "dc=example,dc=local" -D squid at example.local -W /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt -f "(&(objectclass=person)(sAMAccountName=%v)(memberof=cn=%g,ou=Security Groups,ou=MyBusiness,dc=example,dc=local))" -h dc1.example.local
EXAMPLE\Username Internet%20Users%20Standard
Connected OK

When I am trying to complete this command, I get the following message:

Bash:  /usr/lib/squid3/squid_ldap_group:  No such file or directory

I have gone to the directory /usr/lib/squid3/ there is no directory or file with that name.

I have installed Squid version 3.4.8.

I have been searching Google and all over the Squid site to see if I can find any information as to how to resolve this issue, and I have not yet found anything.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that I am inexperienced with the Linux environment, so detailed steps for any additional information collection or resolution would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Okay. I suspect I know what is going on now. Before I confuse things any
more by mentioning it...

Could you send me a wireshark trace of a small bunch of the connections
coming to Squid?  Along with the DNS name for the ELB the clients are
connecting to.

The tutorial(s) a bit old. The Squid-3.2 release notes explain it:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/RELEASENOTES.html#ss2.6>

The new name for the same helper in your Squid version is ext_ldapgroup_acl

The "3" in the "squid3" paths are an artifact of the author having used
a Debian based OS. Your OS may have different paths.

Message-ID: <CAL5Kg5CnvvNxyCa4S2JZ=zF7u_diHprcD-7ev91q01Dj6A9JQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been configured Squid version 3.5.9 and transparent proxy. To do this.
I used the "peek and splice" feature to works with https protocol in
transparent mode. It's works fine.

There is a "acl" to block some sites, like facebook.com, linkedin.com,
etc... It's works fine too.

acl deny_https_sites ssl::server_name_regex "/etc/squid/https_url.txt"
ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites
ssl_bump peek all
ssl_bump splice all


But, now, I need to do an rule to permit access for specific users, or ip
address. But, I don't know if it's possible with ssl_bump. I tried
somethink like:

ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites !permited_ips

or

ssl_bump peek deny_https_sites permited_ips


There is one way to do this?

Thank you for your help Amos.  Due to this new information, I'm looking at the squid.conf file I'm supposed to be writing and I see two statements that I would like to ask about.
1)
auth_param negotiate program /usr/local/bin/negotiate_wrapper -d --ntlm /usr/bin/ntlm_auth --diagnostics --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp --domain=EXAMPLE --kerberos /usr/lib/squid3/squid_kerb_auth -d -s GSS_C_NO_NAME

I know I need to change squid_kerb_auth to negotiate_kerberos_auth, but what I want to ask about is the command --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp  Is this command still valid?  It is in another portion of the squid.conf file as well, so I want to make sure.

Thank you again for your help.

Oops. That should have been:   ext_ldap_group_acl

On that line;

  everything after the "--ntlm" parameter and before the "--kerberos"
parameter are details about the ntlm_auth helper from Samba and its
arguments. They have not changed.

 everything after the "--kerberos" parameter are the Kerberos helper,
its name has changed and its arguments may be different for your AD setup.

On that line;

  everything after the "--ntlm" parameter and before the "--kerberos"
parameter are details about the ntlm_auth helper from Samba and its arguments. They have not changed.

 everything after the "--kerberos" parameter are the Kerberos helper, its name has changed and its arguments may be different for your AD setup.

The above is kind of wrong because it may terminate before learning
enough about the connection. You should terminate after peeking:

  acl ...

  ssl_bump peek all
  ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites
  ssl_bump splice all

Peeking feeds your deny_https_sites ACL with information. Without
peeking, that ACL may only have IP addresses to work with (especially in
an interception environment).

The first variant is theoretically correct, but I recommend avoiding
negation in ACLs: An ACL result is not a boolean "match" or "mismatch".
It is actually closer to "match", "mismatch", "do not know", or "error".
Negating four values correctly is difficult, and Squid itself has had
many bugs in that area.


If you can truly identify "specific users" by IP, then do that first (no
need to peek):

  ssl_bump splice permited_ips
  ssl_bump peek all
  ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites
  ssl_bump splice all


If your actual "specific user" ACL needs host name information, then let
Squid peek first:

  ssl_bump peek all
  ssl_bump splice specific_users
  ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites
  ssl_bump splice all


Your questions indicate that you may not understand how Squid evaluates
ACL rules. Proceed with caution and try reading a guide book or a good
tutorial. The basic single-rule evaluation algorithm is not specific to
SslBump (although multiple ssl_bump directives add more complexity).


Good luck,

Alex.

Hi Eliezer,

First, THANK YOU for packaging squid for CentOS 7! I actually reused your
SRPM for my squid 3.5.x builds, just changed a few options :)

About the issue itself.
> Couple questions?
> Are you running\using ssl-bump or not?

No, not at all, it should just be set to "none"

> access.log?

All I've been seeing is CONNECT messages for the facebook URIs,
nothing in the logs that indicates a failure

 From what I know facebook works in HTTPS and an abort can be mainly
> because of a network issue or application level issue.

It is very unclear, our network team is trying to determine if a
network issue may be in play, but we believe that is unlikely...

I couldn't understand how you ran the tests.
> I do understand that you have two proxies and one is peering to the
> other, right?

Apologies if that wasn't clear, I'll try to give a better explanation:

   - There is always one proxy in this situation.
   - The difference is that we run the proxy out of our secondary
   datacenter and route all user internet traffic through that location so it
   doesn't cause any issues with the traffic to our website flowing in and out
   of our primary datacenter.
   - A test instance I used to recreate the squid instance that is having
   the issues with, works as expected in our primary datacenter, however, the
   older version of squid we were using is located in the secondary datacenter
   and also works as expected, only the newer version doesn't work.


Thanks for your help!

It doesn't look like it's showing anything for the facebook request, just
the ocsp one.

I forgot to mention as well in my earlier reply, we have the proxy
listening over port 10000 if that makes a difference.

For your question:

> Is it breaking only when Squid is in the "other" datacenter from the
> client(s) ?

Not sure if I answered that completely. Clients that are "local" to that
datacenter and not local to it have the same response, however I have been
making my tests from the same location.

Thanks again for your response, please let me know if I can provide any
further information.

I have been attempting to setup a squid forward proxy with one frontend 
and two backends as per configuration example 
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/SmpCarpCluster

My issue is that only the first attempt comes from the cache and then 
additional requests are downloaded direct by the frontend instead of from 
the backend caches. I suspect it is due to a detected forwarding loop 
which shows up in the logs:

I can force the backend caches to be used successfully with this option 
"never_direct allow all" however I would like to resolve the underlying 
issue.

I have no iptables configured on this server and have made sure the 
environment variable http_proxy is not set. Also I have tested this on 
Squid 3.4.8 and 3.5.10 on Debian.

Hey Patrick,

Thanks for clearing the picture out.
Since it's HTTPS traffic it will might be a bit difficult to debug.

I wanted to notify you that squid 3.5.10 is suffering from some bugs but 
it is very hard for me to actually find this specific issue meet any of 
the know bugs else then one bug(something with ssl-bump).

One thing I can think of in this scenario in order to maybe somehow 
change how things are would be to use a second proxy just for the test.
If you can run another proxy on a tiny VM with another IP on the same DC 
as the existing one it would narrow down couple things.
If it works OK with squid default conf file then try to assign the IP of 
the problematic proxy to the new one.
If it works with the same IP it's an issue with something in the proxy 
setup or the conf.


Another approach would be to use the secondary DC proxy as a cache_peer 
of the primary DC proxy to verify if it affects the traffic in a similar 
way.

--
In the first post you have mentioned this link:
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/SmpCarpCluster

This specific example was intended for caching optimization or something 
similar.
Since your case involves CONNECT requests which cannot be cached anyway 
and also this CARP has certain limitations I would first try to simplify 
the setup into a no-disk RAM only cache with couple workers rather then 
multi workers peering.
The CARP example actually limits the whole service to the frontend 
capabilities and there for it's recommended to not use it if possible.
Try a default squid.conf if possible.

Since the issue can be reproduced very easily testing the different 
options will take couple minutes and can be done after work hours.

The above options is what I would have tried with my own servers.

We've got a couple thoughts going at once here, so let me condense it a bit.  First, yes, this is coming in over a satellite and that is part of the bugger.  Nothing like 560 ms to bring a connection to a halt.  Part of my plan is exactly as you say, optimize the links by setting huge tcp_windows and all the rest so that I can get full bandwidth.  The other part of the story (and I could just be misunderstanding this too) is that it appears that if I have say, 3 or 4 clients connect for a file over the course of the period of the download, if any one of them (or maybe just the last one, again, insufficient testing so I don't know the exactly course of events here) ends up requesting an IP different than what is looked up, it appeared to drop the file.

>I think a worse problem is if the DNS TTL is shorter than a client connections TCP connected time. 
>Then requests arriving after the DNS TTL expired would no longer match the initial dst-IP.

That is what I think I was seeing:  if by that you mean, clients A, B, and C all request a large file (few hundred MB), it downloads but takes more than 300 seconds (which has become a pretty common TTL, when did that happen?), and then D requests it too, but the DNS updates while its coming in and suddenly gets flagged as a host forgery and is no longer cacheable.  I could be wrong, so I need to experiment, but I think that?s what I am seeing.

My crazy solution is, I have a server on a fast connection on which I setup a cache there with a pretty big minimum and maximum file size (say, 10 MB minimum object size, 8,000MB maximum) and set it up as a parent cache to the cache out at the slow end of the universe, which is a transparent proxy.  The transparent proxy then uses the parent proxy to request the files, and when the files happen to be very big, I set up the connection to do a pre-cache (because a 100 MB file is a piece of cake for a 100 mbps connection) and it stores it, because the time to download was trivial compared to the DNS TTL.  I set the cache up no the slow end to cache more aggressively, but the point is that once the cache down south has the file, the cache up north is requesting the file from a system much more optimized to pull big files over, and that improves the odds that the DNS has not updated before the transfer completes.

I'm not convinced my idea is valid, so I'll have to ponder it a bit, but I'm going to give it a shot and let you know if it makes a difference.  Bottom line is, it is a pretty nasty work around, and there is probably a better solution if someone that knows C out there worth beans is into it.  I don't think there are ANY answers that don't involve setting up your own DNS, but after configuring BIND in about 7 minutes last night, I am thinking that?s not a big issue.  The obvious answers I can think of are (1) to maintain a short table of IPs associated with a specific domain request until all transfers referring back to it have passed and rewrite the DNS resolution calls to refer to that table or (2) tag the requested IP and resolved IP.

The last line of C I wrote was in the 90s, but I'll dig in and see if I can find the right place to start making a mess :).

In any event, you and Eliezer have helped me get farther since Tuesday night than I had since August, Thank you both!

Hi Eliezer,

Thanks for your response.

I have set up a VM to test out configurations in the same data center and
address space as the problematic one.
What I haven't done is test it by rebuilding the squid configuration from
the defaults up and trying to use the same IP, that will probably be what
I'll try tomorrow.

Also, thanks for the tip on the CARP example. I was trying to find a
configuration that took advantage of SMP, but I see how that complicates
things further.

Thanks so much for the suggestions! I'll update this thread further if
things start working a bit better.
And thank you again for packaging newer squid versions for CentOS!

First try to test it with default squid.conf and only adding to the 
localnet the local networks address space\subnet on the current proxy.

SMP can work without any relation to the CARP example.
It is limited to rock cache_dir and ram cache.
I would start with a RAM cache only and a number of workers.
The number of workers you will be required to use depends on your 
network load.
You can try with 2 workers and use the squid cache manager interface to 
see if you have high requests per second rate per worker.
If you need some hints on that I will try to find the exact values in 
the cache manager interface.

Hey,

I was convinced that there was an option to disable the host forgery 
test, which will make more sense if you will use bind and will intercept 
all DNS traffic into it.

About your idea for an upstream cache.
It's a pretty nice idea, I am pretty sure that the host forgery test can 
be disabled in a case you are using an upstream cache_peer.
If it is not in the code yet it should be reported as a bug.(some can 
argue it is a wanted feature)
The idea by itself is not crazier that what I have done at: 
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator

The idea of pre-fetching is old and I had an intention to write and ICAP 
service that will do something like that but with the full original 
request headers.
The issue with a pre-fetching of a file is that you will be required to 
download the file at-least twice and the first request will might not be 
saved into the cache as it should.
If you plan to implement pre-fetching consider using some ICAP service 
that will know about the full request headers to mimic the exact same 
request.
If you do have interest in the ICAP idea take a look at the the ICAP 
service I wrote(in Golang) at:
https://github.com/elico/squidblocker-icap-server
You can see that in the filterByUrl function the req.Request object 
content can be dumped and re-used for the pre-fetch.

There is host_verify_strict to set the checking to set it between
super-strict paranoia (on), and allow the one client to be borked but
protect others (off, which is the default).

There is client_dst_passthru to use the client provided dst-IP as first
preferred destination (on), or to do the same server selection as
explicit-proxy traffic does regardless of where the client was trying to
go (off).
 * Turning this off can be faster but break sites which make bad
assumptions about end-to-end sessions or otherwise depend on IP-based
security sessions, so the default is on.
 * It does not affect the host_verify_strict decision, only applies when
the Host header is detected as okay.
 * It does nothing when a cache_peer is being relayed through as the
only upstream option.

Yes, traffic being received at an explicit-proxy syntax (eg. from an
front-end proxy) does not have host verification applied unless you
decide to set the super-paranoid mode to on. Host verification is only
applied on the proxy doing NAT intercept or TPROXY.

If this is a big problem you can try "collapsed_forwarding on".

It has a few annoying bugs of its own still. One of which is that it
could slow down collapsed requests even more if the response turns out
to be non-cacheable or unusable for that client. But it would resolve
the situation above. YMMV.

Unfortunately in a busy proxy very popular domains stay popular and have
outstanding requests almost all the time. If they have a short outage or
migrate to other IPs (like the cloud and CDN services causing this
grief) then the proxy is left sending new requests to dead servers and
the clients see a lot of extra unnecessary breakage.

Of my ideas the simplest to put together would be to tie the intercepted
connection to the single Host header value that got verified.

To work on that you need to edit src/client_side_request.cc, look for
the hostVerify methods. When a verify passes add the confirmed hostname
to the ConnStateData object (src/client_side.h), and use that stored
value to accept as verified the furture requests have the same Host
value as seen before, instead of re-doing DNS lookups on the 2nd, 3rd
etc requests.

The above is an internal Squid request from the fontend to its backends.
This one specifically is going direct due to a hack in the code.

You can avoid it by adding "no-netdb-exchange" to the cache_peer lines.
I'm not sure if that will affect the CARP selection since these requests
are one of the types feeding into the peer up/down/overloaded
monitoring. With "no-query" also in use you will be left with the client
HTTP traffic being the only source of that data which carp depends on.

Or using that "never_direct allow all" will override that code hack.

Since you have no iptables rules configured the traffic arriving in port
3129 will be completely borked.

Either, remove that port 3129 line from the frontend config and use port
3128 for testing until you are ready to setup TPROXY properly;

Or, setup the TPROXY iptables and routing rules and test the proxy
exactly as the clients would be using it.

With squid_servers IP range being entirely within "localnet" this
"http_access allow squid_servers" line is not doing anything.
You can simplify by removing it.

Nod. All that did previously was prevent forwarding loops between the
backends in case something unusually nasty happened in the
routing/iptabels layers. What you have now is okay and slightly better
for diagnosing the issues.

Thanks for your reply, Amos. But how to exclude SSPI helper from compilation? I've tried running "configure" script with --enable-auth-negotiate="kerberos wrapper", and also with --enable-auth-negotiate="none", but in both cases during "make" phase an attempt to compile SSPI helper is made, and the process fails.

Also, I know about Diladele precompiled distributive, and tried it at first, but it misses ext_ad_group_acl helper which I would like to use, so I tried to compile from source. Squid version available as Cygwin package also misses it.

Best regards,
Vadim Yakovlev

So, what?

wpad.dat can be placed in any directory in Apache's direstory structure.
Most often it placed in ServerRoot, under htdocs directory. What's the
problem?

Firstly, what O/S, distro, version are you doing this on?

Secondly, is Apache correctly running on the machine?  Can you get a default 
test page or similar by pointing a browser at the server?

Thirdly, you may be better off asking this sort of thing on an Apache list, 
because it's not part of configuring Squid, really.

Antony.

I debian meaning, backporting means building newer package using old
tools/libraries (when possible).
So, in fact, you are recommending backporting instead of using
unstable/testing debian version (which is quite risky for system stability)

Thank you Antony,

Here are the O/S version information I believe you asked for.

O/S - Debian 8.2
Squid - 3.4.8
Apache 2.4.10

I am following the instructions located at this website:  http://wiki.bitbinary.com/index.php/Active_Directory_Integrated_Squid_Proxy

As well as this website:  http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Authenticate/WindowsActiveDirectory

Not being really familiar with the Linux environment, has made the configuration of the system, challenging.

Okay, looks good.

Do you get an Apache test page if you point a browser at the IP address of the 
server?

What is the output of the following command?

	ls -al /etc/apache2

This seems to be fixed in 3.5.10. Tough I still see a few large-ish
negative numbers (-7373 for example) they seem to stop growing indefinitely.

Antony,

I get the Apache2 Debian Default page when I got the address of the server.

Here are the results of the command:

If it really has to be WPAD (auto-dscovery), it must be in root of the wpad
host so it can be accessed as "wpad.<host>/wpad.dat"

Aha, that's a difference between Apache 2.2 (as documented in the guide notes 
you're following) and 2.4 (which comes with Debian 8).

You should put your wpad.conf file into /etc/apache2/conf-available and then 
enable it with the command:

	a2enconf wpad

Hope that helps,


Antony.

Thanks for your reply Alex,

I understood your considerations. Maybe, I really didn't understand very
well how the SslBump works, the differences between peek and splice and
steps SslBump1, 2 and 3.

I'm searching and studing about this last two days, and I need to undertand
better about this questions.

There's a way to join ssl_bump + a simple acl? Basicly, I would like to
permit access to some sites, like facebbok, linkedin, for example. during a
period of day time, for example:

acl after_work time MTWHFAS 18:00-21:00
ssl_bump terminate deny_https_sites !after_work

Thanks,

You can use any ACL (or any combination of ACLs) with ssl_bump rules if
the ACLs you are using have enough information to work correctly during
ssl_bump steps. For example, the "time" ACL always has enough information.

SslBump steps only have access to information in an HTTP CONNECT request
(or equivalent). What information is available in that CONNECT request
depends on Squid version, Squid configuration, current transaction, and
current SslBump step. I do not think there is detailed documentation
about available information. Somebody should write it.

You may have found them already, but if not these wiki pages should help
you understand a bit more.

The particular one Alex and I think you need to understand is
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl> which documents how
Squid access controls operate. What they are and how to use them.

Once you understand the ACLs you may have a clearer idea how to extend
yoru rules properly using the information in
<http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice>. Which documents
what the SSL-Bump actions are, what they do and at what stages of the
TLS handshake process they can happen.

Once you understand what the "Common Mistakes" section of the ACL wiki
page is talking about you will know the answer to your question. It
describes the problem Alex was talking about, but in slightly simpler terms.

Hint: you say you want to permit things. But you are writing rules with
"deny" / "terminate" as the action for Squid to do. Seems a bit
backwards, yes?

The outcome of the above rules may be the behaviour you desire. But the
rule is not specifying the policy you wrote about. It is specifying
another policy that happens to act the same (most of the time). And
"most of the time" is how strange problems appear later.



PS. Apologies if we seems to be obstructing. But you really do need to
properly know how Squid ACLs work if you are going to be configuring
Squid. They are used for controlling almost everything, as you will see
in those wiki pages.

Your still doing the policy description != policy rules thing.

Whereas your last emails rules match the above description.
Below is a policy that matches your last emails description.

Stop thinking of HTTPS as a single thing. It is not.

It is a TLS protocol layer, with an HTTP protocol layer inside it. The
TLS layer has its own messages completely different and separate from
the HTTP ones.

http_access rules tell Squid what to do with HTTP layer messages. Either
the ones Squid is receiving straight on top of TCP (aka plain text
HTTP), or ones it decrypted from inside the TLS layer (aka HTTPS).

ssl_bump tells Squid how to treat each of the TLS layer operations that
occur before the first encrypted HTTPS message. We call them stage 1, 2
and 3.


Your configuration so far is using splice to mean allow and terminate to
mean deny. But the peek and splice feature is not http_access, it is a
bit more complicated than allow/deny.

There is _type_ of metadata the ACLs are accessing (CONNECT wrapper
[step1], client handshake data [step2], server certificate [step3])
affecting what the ACLs will match against. Then what was done at the
previous step(s) affect what actions are possible now.

That fixed it. Of course its using IPv6 to talk between the front and back ends.

I have fixed this issue.

The Kernel Image I am using is configured with

*CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK =y 
<http://192.168.192.46/ksn-100/linux-rockchip/commit/cfc6ca5f859517957c323c340d754338211dbc61>
*

changing this to

*# CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK is not set 
<http://192.168.192.46/ksn-100/linux-rockchip/commit/cfc6ca5f859517957c323c340d754338211dbc61>*

and a rebuild has solved the issue.

Thanks again Amos for prodding me along to the fix.
