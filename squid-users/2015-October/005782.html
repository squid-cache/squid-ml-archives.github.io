That has not been true since Squid-3.1. Squid which are HTTP/1.1 enabled
can and do cache dynamic content quite easily.

</I>
That depends on what is being tweaked. The options and values that are
marked as violation are so, the others are safe to be adjusted if you
need them.

</I>
Yeah we cache so much *more* than 30% nowdays.
Of course ones log analyzer has to notice that the transactions logged
as REFRESH are also cached objects, not only the ones labelled HIT.
