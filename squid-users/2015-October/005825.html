</I>Should that show up in the logs somewhere? Put it this way: we have a
situation where &quot;something&quot; is causing a website that works without bump
to not work with it. If squid doesn't &quot;like&quot; something, could it
&quot;auto-splice&quot; - or at the very least log that there's a problem?

I'd like to find out what squid doesn't like about it because I could
probably update my external_acl_type script to detect that situation and
make squid splice the session (BTW my script already verifies the real
cert using the same CAs file that squid uses and it says it's legit - so
I don't think it's actually got anything to do with the CA itself)
