That's a bit hard for us to tell without knowing:

 - the site the user was trying to access (so we can see what sort of HTML it 
returns, or try it on our own Squid setups, for example)

 - your Squid configuration (so we can see why the access ought to have worked)

 - what showed up in the Squid log file when the user tried to access the site 
(so we can see what Squid was asked to do, what it did, and what the result 
was).


I suggest you:

 - tell us the URL

 - post your squid.conf without blank lines or comments (obscuring any 
sensitive data, if present)

 - post the Squid access log for the session (removing detail from any other 
sessions so long as you're sure they are unrelated).


That may give us some useful information to work on.


Regards,


Antony.
