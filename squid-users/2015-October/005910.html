</I>&gt;<i> to HTTPS, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This approach makes me wonder the following questions and I would like to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Can squid acting as a reverse proxy deal with caching with SSL similar

</I>&gt;<i> cache_peer ssl; https_port accel and cache_peer (not ssl); http_port accel
</I>&gt;<i> and cache_peer ssl; http_port and cache_peer (not ssl)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding is that, yes, it can do it and that Squid get the content
</I>&gt;<i> from the cache_peer (encrypted if ssl), decrypt it if encrypted and store it
</I>&gt;<i> always not encrypted. Am I right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Can Squid use a SSL cache_peer just for specific addresses of the same
</I>&gt;<i> website/domain and a non SSL cache_peer for the rest of the addresses on the
</I>&gt;<i> same website/domain?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding is that such a thing would be possible setting those two
</I>&gt;<i> different named cache_peers, one on port 443 with the ssl option and the
</I>&gt;<i> other on port 80; and then using acl urlpath_regex to choose what cache_peer
</I>&gt;<i> to use. Is that correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, and no. There is no complication about whether things have arrived
over a TCP connection vs TLS connection. They are just connections with
different URL schemes to a reverse-proxy. The client and server
connections in HTTP are independent.

Caching depends only on the message itself. What type of connection it
was received over is irrelevant.


FYI:

1) TLS (or SSL) is just a transport protocol to Squid, like TCP.

2) HTTPS is just HTTP transferred over a TLS connection.

All your questions come back to those details.
