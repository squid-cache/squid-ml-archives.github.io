No it is HTTP version 2.0. As in the next-generation specification
release after 1.1.

Correct in that there is no such requirement. It is simply the Chrome
and Firefox developers are refusing to implement plain-text HTTP/2 for
port 80 usage, or support for proxies.

Almost all the other tools you will find supporting HTTP/2 can do so
happily over port 80. Some do not even support the TLS / HTTPS form of
HTTP/2.

And &quot;50% faster&quot; is false. The IETF HTTPbis WG only got a 20% latency
reduction. And take that with a grains of salt too, the measurements
were only taken for single browser-&gt;server hops. Since at the time no
tools supported proxies and no proxies existed for HTTP/2.
Still a great result, but not as big as 50%.


&gt;<i> Notably google was talking about http2 support on

</I>&gt;<i> use the bump to TLS2, but still allow the main

</I>
There is ongoing work to add it to Squid. But it has no sponsor paying
for it to happen anytime soon and been slowed the last few months as I
prepare for Squid-4 release.
&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTP2">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTP2</A>&gt;

HTTP/2 takes multiplexing to a whole new level above what HTTP/1.1
contains, which has been a design challenge. Squid-4 includes a lot of
the redesign work, but unfortunately I did not get the payload stream
and coders finished yet.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is partly being supported through the current
</I>&gt;<i> squid by encapsulating a http2 session in a
</I>&gt;<i> http1.1 &quot;tunnel&quot; -- which raises some problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> All the kinks aren't worked out yet, but
</I>&gt;<i> Proxy-Users scenarios are shown at:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Proxy-User-Stories">https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Proxy-User-Stories</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
And yet the only browser that will support sending HTTP/2 to a proxy is
MS IE. The more popular ones are simply refusing to implement half the
specification. It does not bode well for interoperability.



&gt;<i> Are the impacts or implementation details
</I>&gt;<i> being thought about in squid?, since if it comes
</I>&gt;<i> down to it only being supported by encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> TUNNELS, its not only going to be hard to cache,
</I>&gt;<i> but also makes it a pain to implement http/browsing
</I>&gt;<i> controls on content -- since it would all
</I>&gt;<i> be encrypted and and compressed and impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to directly use in companies that need to filter
</I>&gt;<i> web-content as it comes in.
</I>
Those problems are not HTTP/2 related. As you noticed there is no TLS
requirement in the specification. They are side effects of the &quot;TLS
everywhere&quot; campaign that those same browser vendors have taken up.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A bit concerned...
</I>&gt;<i> linda
</I>
Squid can MITM the TLS tunnels. When it does so it strips away the
tokens negotiating SPDY, HTTP/2 and QUIC to make the communication be
HTTP/1.1 over the proxy.
