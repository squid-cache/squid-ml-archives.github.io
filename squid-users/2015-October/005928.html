<PRE>Linda, Linda Walsh everywhere :p.

I only trashed your message. I love to trash Linda Walsh :P :P.

Okay, pointless message.

Thanks for mentioning it here, I didn't even know about it, like you. And 
of course you study it really well before commenting, mostly unlike me :p.

I have this feeling that I like SPDY better than HTTP2? Anyone agree?

HTTP2 only defines the transit/connection, right? The compression, 
multiplexing. It seems a bit incredulous to call it a new HTTP version.

It also seems to be sponsoring corporate interests. I have this tight 
feeling that it's mostly to do with a few top-10 websites like Facebook 
and Twitter and Google and so on.

The lean web is long past.

Anyone ever notice how CDNs are usually the things preventing loading of a 
page? It is usually a remote source that is hanging a page load. I mean 
external to the website itself.

Facebook itself requires at least 300-500K per page and that is just the 
frame that is sent first. After that it starts pipelining the rest of the 
&quot;real&quot; content.

They are already compressing all of their javascript to use 
shortest-possible names (identifiers) and it is still this big.

Me still wonders why &quot;paging&quot; was not a good model. I avoid webshops that 
use a continuous-load page, and thankfully there are not many.

Just the fact that the browser developers are refusing certain things, 
makes it rather clear they are ... not sure how to frame or phrase it. 
Let's just call it &quot;having an agenda&quot;.

I remember how... well. You know, Apache and the no-tracking thing by 
Microsoft as a default, and Apache was pushed by &quot;the industry&quot; to ignore 
Microsoft's flag/request. The guy basically said that he was fed up with 
the bullying and just complied.

I believe the browser vendors are basically &quot;owned&quot; by a group centering 
around Facebook and Google. Just an impression based on their behaviours. 
The way they are pushing invalidation of older certificates in order to 
maintain security. It's not reasonable, and whenever something is not 
reasonable, something else is not being said.

Sounds a bit paranoid perhaps. Perhaps I find it more important than it 
really is.

Regards, B.
