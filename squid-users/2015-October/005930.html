Enough to verify what I am saying, usually, but I have expert 
knowledge in almost no field that I know of.  I do have 
fundamentals that help me build understanding of new things,
but now days, teaching fundamentals is passe, because
employers look for those who can just code and ask
few questions ;-/

&gt;<i>, mostly unlike 
</I>&gt;<i> me :p.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have this feeling that I like SPDY better than HTTP2? Anyone agree?

	You might want to read just 2 pages:
<A HREF="http://http2.github.io/">http://http2.github.io/</A> (very short, but good for the links)
  and
<A HREF="http://http2.github.io/faq/">http://http2.github.io/faq/</A>
	
On the 2nd you would see:
  After a call for proposals and a selection process, SPDY/2 was chosen as the 
  basis for HTTP/2. ...  In February 2015, Google announced its plans to remove
  support for SPDY in favor of HTTP/2.


&gt;<i> HTTP2 only defines the transit/connection, right? The compression, 
</I>&gt;<i> multiplexing. It seems a bit incredulous to call it a new HTTP version.
</I>---
  On second page mentioned above:

   What are the key differences to HTTP/1.x?
   At a high level, HTTP/2:

     o  is binary, instead of textual
     o  is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
     o  can therefore use one connection for parallelism
     o  uses header compression to reduce overhead
     o  allows servers to &#8220;push&#8221; responses proactively into client caches

---

My biggest annoyance is the SSL/TLS everywhere... because I want to see
what is coming from where and possibly be able to block it -- which is 
*EXACTLY* why web-content owners/presenters are wanting it -- to remove
avenues of control and introspection into their processes.
