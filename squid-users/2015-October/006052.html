<PRE>This post was just in place since I wanted to add a section to the 
StoreID wiki.

StoreID is great but it gives a limited functionality.
Any site that present ETAG in the response breaks the StoreID functionality.
I have tested in the last couple weeks more then one site with a custom 
StoreID helper and it seems that since squid recreates the object 
HASH\STOREID it makes the StoreID helper decision useless.

I was considering the options to solve the issue in the past but nothing 
has been done until now.
Alex mentioned the option to Give ICAP the option to return a StoreID 
based on the response from the service.
I can see couple issues with this approach since on any ICAP response 
for a RESPMOD the body part is important and an integral part of the answer.

So even if someone claims to cache some sites with StoreID some sites 
cannot be de-duplicated using StoreID until some patches will be applied 
to squid.
