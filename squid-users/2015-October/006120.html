If you have cache_effective_user or cache_effective_group directives in
your config file remove them. They break the Winbind helpers group
permissions.


Were your successful tests made using the Squid low-privileged user
account ?
 If no, then your test results are not relevant. Re-test as the Squid
user. Which will need membership of the winbindd_priv group.

What Windows version are the IE and Firefox being run on?
If it is newer than Windows 2000, then you should be moving to
Negotiate/Kerberos authentication instead of NTLM.

Does the client machine have Windows Integrated Authentication enabled?
and is it on-domain?
 Off-domain machines have no chance of NTLM working. Disable their
integrated authentication settings.
Note that without the integrated auth Firefox has no access to NTLM
credentials and MSIE has a tendency to use the machine credentials
instead of the users.

</I>
You should list Basic as first choice since it is the more secure of
those two protocols.

Sounds like a joke, but it is true NTLM is less secure these days than
Basic auth. Namely because clients that accept NTLM can be
auto-downgraded by attackers to using LanMan protocols that broadcast
the username and password just like Basic - BUT most network software
treats Basic auth as the insecure one and do a lot more to protect its
weak credentials.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> acl AuthorizedUsers proxy_auth REQUIRED
</I>&gt;<i> http_access allow localnet
</I>&gt;<i> http_access allow AuthorizedUsers
</I>&gt;<i> http_access allow localhost
</I>
The above implies that the authenticated users will be outside the LAN
(localnet). The 'L' in NTLM is &quot;LAN&quot; and old 1980-1990's style flat LAN
networks are where it was designed for use. It does *not* work properly
over Internet connections or even in many of todays complex LAN
environments.

You need Negotiate/Kerberos auth for Internet clients to even have half
a chance of authenticating securely. Then you also need to get the whole
on/off domain thing sorted out and working.


PS. you will probably need a few hundred helpers for NTLM. It is an
*extremely* inefficient protocol. I've not seen even a home network
operate with less than 50, usual minimum is 100.
