<PRE>Hi Amos ,

thanks for your reply.

Maybe we got an misunderstanding or I have an &quot;false&quot; opinion of the sentence I quoted before.

I thought you could say to me what for checks would definitely performed in &quot;standard&quot; installation with openssl,

not only that you believe that the X.509 certificate syntax and properties would be checked in correctness and the signer.

I&#180;m sorry for these remark , but for me it's important to know what checks would performed to prevent another on the same thing and slow down the &quot;process&quot;.


Another question regarding the Options from &quot;sslcrtvalidator_program&quot;,
ttl &quot; TTL in seconds for cached results. The default is 60 secs&quot;

Is the cached results referred to the sslhost ?

For example , I configured that the TTL is 12 hours.
A request from Client A is performed to <A HREF="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</A> the validator report back to squid that the certificate is ok and the connection would be spliced/bumped,
1 hour later Client B perform a request again too <A HREF="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</A> , would squid use the &quot;cached&quot; answer from the validator used ?


And another question regarding the cache option.
What from the response would be cached , the complete one or maybe only the sslhost and response code ?

Would it be defined as byte in as the validator and speak ?

The &quot;internal&quot; validation is done by OpenSSL library. So whatever it is doing based on the configuration you give it.

I believe that includes X.509 certificate syntax validity, and X.509 properties validity in light of the TLS extensions negotiated on the connection, and a check the cert was signed by one of the system default Trusted-CA authorities (unless flags=NO_DEFAULT_CA was used) or a custom CA you loaded (with cafile=/capath= options).

There may be more (or less) happening but that is the bulk of it. And all inside OpenSSL so we can't easily debug the what/when/how of it when the output messages are obscure.
