     At first that (caching only 'big' things) was the idea, but when i 
look to cache instagram, that really changed. I know i dont have a good 
hardware (I/O limitation) and having a VERY heterogenous group of 
people, hits were low when caching 'everything' and, in some cases, 
access was even getting slower as i do have a good internet pipe. But 
caching windows update and other 'big things' (antivirus updates, apple 
updates, etc etc) still looked interesting to me.

     As you suggested, i further enhanced my ACLs that match 'what i 
want to cache' and could get it working using cache rules. I have even, 
in some cases, created two ACLs, one for the dstdom and other for the 
urlpath for matching just some extensions i want to cache. Maybe not 
perfect, but seems to be working fine after lowering the 
minimum_object_size to some few KBs.
