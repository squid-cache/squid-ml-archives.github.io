Wish I could give some better help. But there have been a few situations
where people have ended up in the same mystery situation with TPROXY and
one of us found a solution yet. That was usually on Debian/Ubuntu
systems though. Whatever the bug was did seem to get fixed in more
recent kernels for them.
