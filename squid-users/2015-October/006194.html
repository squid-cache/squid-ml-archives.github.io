I can not understand why so much dropped for caching of https. This is
very critical in the modern conditions, for obvious reasons. In older
versions of the same for this to work. And it does not have the
slightest desire to write or use a third-party services or crutches. As
well as the search for workaround for functionality that worked yesterday.

</I>&gt;<i> OK then, if it's that important for you and it worth money for the
</I>business you are running\working for think about writing an ECAP module
or an ICAP service that will do this same thing and sometimes will do
more then you are asking for.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't mentioned this before but you if you are using a non tproxy
</I>environment you can use two squid instances to get the same effect.
&gt;<i> You would be able to asses the network stress you have and decide
</I>which of the solution is for you.
&gt;<i> Maybe you are already know the article I wrote at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Which you can use to use a similar thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my side of the picture I think you are over-simplifying the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot speak for everyone and I know that there are other opinions
</I>about this subject and similar other but, I can say for sure that from
what I have seen, squid have had many issues which resulted from the
basic fact the it was something like a &quot;geany in lamp&quot; project which
many just asked for something they needed.
&gt;<i> If you do not know, some literally *hate* squid.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the reasons is that it has a huge list of open bugs which are
</I>waiting for someone to find them attractive enough to write a patch for
them.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yes with exactly the same parameters which resulted in 85% cache
</I>hit you are now getting 0% like you should have been.
&gt;<i> I am not sure how many users are happy with this change and I
</I>encourage others to write their opinions and ideas about it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am staying with my suggestions for a set of solutions for the
</I>specific issue.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not the greatest squid programmer but if someone will fund my
</I>time I will might be able to write a module that will do just what you
and maybe others want. And if I might add that it's like in any other
software, you have an API and you can use it. if you think it's
important file a bug and send your question to the squid-dev list with
hope that you will get some answers even if these will not be to your
liking.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All The Bests,
</I>&gt;<i> Eliezer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Somebody told me on squid once something like &quot;I am sharing your
</I>sorrow&quot; while I was very happy with it.
