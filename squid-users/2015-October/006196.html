<PRE>I cannot speak for the Squid project and you may ask the squid-dev more 
about it and also see the release notes about it.
What I can is that the phrase &quot;it's not a bug, it's a feature&quot; can work 
the other way around &quot;it's not a feature, it's a bug&quot; and as you have 
mentioned &quot;it worked yesterday&quot; and yes... some will look at this as a 
bug from a caching point of view.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK then, if it's that important for you and it worth money for the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I didn't mentioned this before but you if you are using a non tproxy
</I>&gt;<i> environment you can use two squid instances to get the same effect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You would be able to asses the network stress you have and decide
</I>&gt;<i> which of the solution is for you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe you are already know the article I wrote at:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/Coordinator</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which you can use to use a similar thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From my side of the picture I think you are over-simplifying the issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I cannot speak for everyone and I know that there are other opinions
</I>&gt;<i> about this subject and similar other but, I can say for sure that from
</I>&gt;<i> what I have seen, squid have had many issues which resulted from the
</I>&gt;<i> basic fact the it was something like a &quot;geany in lamp&quot; project which
</I>&gt;<i> many just asked for something they needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you do not know, some literally *hate* squid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the reasons is that it has a huge list of open bugs which are
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for someone to find them attractive enough to write a patch for
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And yes with exactly the same parameters which resulted in 85% cache
</I>&gt;<i> hit you are now getting 0% like you should have been.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure how many users are happy with this change and I
</I>&gt;<i> encourage others to write their opinions and ideas about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am staying with my suggestions for a set of solutions for the
</I>&gt;<i> specific issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not the greatest squid programmer but if someone will fund my
</I>&gt;<i> time I will might be able to write a module that will do just what you
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe others want. And if I might add that it's like in any other
</I>&gt;<i> software, you have an API and you can use it. if you think it's
</I>&gt;<i> important file a bug and send your question to the squid-dev list with
</I>&gt;<i> hope that you will get some answers even if these will not be to your
</I>&gt;<i> liking.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
