I dont understand what you mean by that.

You started caching HTTPS and ratio dropped?


HTTPS is less than 30% of total traffic. But;

* has a higher proportion of Cache-Control: private or no-store
messages, and

* the store entries for URI with <A HREF="http://">http://</A> and <A HREF="https://">https://</A> are different
objects even if the rest of the URI is identical.

* has a larger amount of Chrome 'sdch' encoding requests.

Any one of the above can cause more MISS by increasing the churn of
non-cacheable content. The wider object space is also trying to fit into
the same cache space/capacity, reducing the time any <A HREF="http://">http://</A> or <A HREF="https://">https://</A>
object will be cached.
 Don't expect HIT rates for HTTP+HTTPS caching to be the same as for
HTTP-only caching. You likely need to re-calculate all your tuning.
