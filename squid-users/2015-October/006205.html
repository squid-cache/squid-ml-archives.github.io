<PRE>I understand perfectly. However - I changed version of the proxy and 
everywhere at the same time changed the headlines? Now I will return the 
version 3.4 and everything will be as it was. I already did.


That's why I ask the question - what has changed so much that the same 
configuration I get 10 times smaller cache hit.

26.10.15 16:29, Eliezer Croitoru &#1087;&#1080;&#1096;&#1077;&#1090;:
&gt;<i> Hey Yuri,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What have you tried until now to understand the situation of the issue?
</I>&gt;<i> From your basic question I was sure that you ran some tests on some 
</I>&gt;<i> well defined objects.
</I>&gt;<i> To asses the state of squid you would need some static objects and 
</I>&gt;<i> some changing objects.
</I>&gt;<i> You would also be required to test using a simple UA like a 
</I>&gt;<i> script\wget\curl and using a fully fledged UA such as 
</I>&gt;<i> chrome\firefox\explorer\opera\safari.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can try to give you couple cache friendly sites which will show you 
</I>&gt;<i> what the basic status of squid.
</I>&gt;<i> In the past someone here asked how to cache the site: <A HREF="http://djmaza.info/">http://djmaza.info/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which by default is built using lots of static content such as html 
</I>&gt;<i> pages, pictures and good css and also implements cache headers nicely.
</I>&gt;<i> I still do not know why wordpress main pages do not have a valid cache 
</I>&gt;<i> headers, and what I mean by that is: Is it not possible to have a page 
</I>&gt;<i> cached for 60 seconds? how much updates can accrue in 60 seconds? 
</I>&gt;<i> would a &quot;must-revalidate&quot; cost that much compared to what there is 
</I>&gt;<i> now?(maybe it does).
</I>&gt;<i> Another one would be <A HREF="https://www.yahoo.com/">https://www.yahoo.com/</A> which is mostly fine with 
</I>&gt;<i> cache and define their main page with &quot;Cache-Control: no-store, 
</I>&gt;<i> no-cache, private, max-age=0&quot; since it's a news page which updates too 
</I>&gt;<i> much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was looking for cache testing subjects and I am still missing couple 
</I>&gt;<i> examples\options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until now what have mainly used for basic test was redbot.org and a 
</I>&gt;<i> local copy of it for testing purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> And while writing to you looking for test subjects I have seen that my 
</I>&gt;<i> own web server have a question for squid.
</I>&gt;<i> I have an example case which gives a great example how to &quot;break&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> squid cache.
</I>&gt;<i> So I have my website and the main page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ngtech.co.il/">http://ngtech.co.il/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://ngtech.co.il/">https://ngtech.co.il/</A> (self signed certificate)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that would be cached properly by squid!
</I>&gt;<i> If for any reason I would remove the Last-Modified header from the 
</I>&gt;<i> page it would become un-cachable in squid (3.5.10) with default settings.
</I>&gt;<i> Accidentally I turned ON the apache option to treat html as php using 
</I>&gt;<i> the apache configuration line:
</I>&gt;<i> AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which is recommended to be used by the first google result for &quot;html 
</I>&gt;<i> as php&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Once you will try the next page(with this setting on):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/">http://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/">https://ngtech.co.il/squidblocker/</A> (self signed certificate)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will see that it is not being cached at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Redbot.org claims that the cache is allowed it's own freshness for the 
</I>&gt;<i> object but squid (3.5.10) will not cache it what so ever and no matter 
</I>&gt;<i> what I do.
</I>&gt;<i> When I am removing &quot;http as php&quot; tweak the page response with a 
</I>&gt;<i> Last-Modified header and can be cached again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am unsure who is the culprit for the issue but I will ask about it 
</I>&gt;<i> in a separated thread *if* I will get no response here.(sorry for 
</I>&gt;<i> partially top-posting)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hey Yuri,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure if you think that Squid version 4 with extreme low hit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ratio is bad or not but I can understand your sight about things.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Usually I am redirecting to this page:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID/CollisionRisks#Several_real_world_examples">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreID/CollisionRisks#Several_real_world_examples</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But this time I can proudly say that the squid project is doing things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right way while it might not be understood by some.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Before you or anyone declares that there is a low hit ratio due to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that is missing I will try to put some sense into how things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looks in the real world.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Small thing from a nice day of mine:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was sitting talking with a friend of mine, a MD to be exact and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while we were talking I was just comforting him about the wonders of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Computers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> He was complaining on how the software in the office moves so slow and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he needs to wait for the software to response with results. So I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hesitated a bit but then I asked him &quot;What would have happen if some MD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here in the office will receive the wrong content\results on a patient
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the software? he described it to me terrified from the question 'He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can get the wrong decision!' and then I described to him how he is in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a good place when he doesn't need to fear from such scenarios.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In this same office Squid is being used for many things and it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crucial that besides the option to cache content the possibility to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validate cache properly will be set right.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do understand that there is a need for caches and sometimes it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crucial in order to give the application more CPU cycles or more RAM but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes the hunger for cache can consume the actual requirement for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the content integrity and it must be re-validated from time to time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have seen couple times how a cache in a DB or other levels results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a very bad and unwanted result while I do understand some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity and caution that the programmers take when building all sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of systems with cache in them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you do want to understand more about the subject pick your favorite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripting language and just try to implement a simple object caching.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You would then see how complex the task can be and you can maybe then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand why caches are not such a simple thing and specially why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignore-no-cache should not be used in any environment if it is possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While I do advise you to not use it I would hint you and others on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another approach to the subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you are greedy and you have hunger for cache for specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sites\traffic and you would like to be able to benefit from over-caching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is a solution for that!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - You can alter\hack squid code to meet your needs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - You can write an ICAP service that will be able to alter the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response headers so squid would think it is cachable by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - You can write an ECAP module that will be able to alter the response
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headers ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Write your own cache service with your algorithms in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Take in account that the squid project tries to be as fault tolerance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as possible due to it being a very sensitive piece of software in very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big production systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Squid doesn't try to meet the requirement of &quot;Maximum Cache&quot; and it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not squid that as a caching proxy makes a reduction of any cache 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> percentage!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The reason that the content is not cachable is due to all these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application that describe their content as not cachable!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For a second of sanity from the the squid project, try to contact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> google\youtube admins\support\operators\forces\what-ever to understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how would you be able to benefit from a local cache.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If and when you do manage to contact them let them know I was looking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a contact and I never managed to find one of these available to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the phone or email. You cannot say anything like that on the squid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project, the squid project can be contacted using an email and if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required you can get a hold of the man behind the software(while he is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> human).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I will try to write it in a geeky way:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deny_info 302:<A HREF="https://support.google.com/youtube/">https://support.google.com/youtube/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big_system_that_doesnt_want_to_be_cached
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Eliezer
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * P.S If you do want to write an ICAP service or an ECAP module to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replace the &quot;ignore-no-cache&quot; I can give you some code that will might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help you as a starter.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pay attention to whether someone from the test SQUID 4 as extremely low

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> HTTPS directive &quot;no cache&quot;? After replacing the Squid 3.4 to 4 squid

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This HTTP caches normally. However, due to the widespread use of HTTPS

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Noticed there anyone else this effect? And what is now with caching?
