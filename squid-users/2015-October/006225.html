Ah, ok:

We see in redbot.org this info in server response:

 Cache-Control: no-cache



So, what? 3.5.10 permit ignore this. 4.0.x - deny.

Squid decides?

Maybe I'll decide what and how to cache in the my setup?

</I>&gt;<i> You are asking a good question. I do not think anybody knows the exact

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the following procedure is almost guaranteed to lead you to the
</I>&gt;<i> answer:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Find a URL/resource that was served from the cache in v3 but became a
</I>&gt;<i> miss in v4. You probably have access.logs that can be used for that. If
</I>&gt;<i> not, enable them and run more experiments. Since your drop in hit ratio
</I>&gt;<i> is so drastic, it should not take long to find a URL that was usually a
</I>&gt;<i> hit before and is usually a miss now (or that becomes a hit/miss as soon
</I>&gt;<i> as you switch to v3/4).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Reproduce the v4 miss with an ALL,9 cache.log and share that log. Do
</I>&gt;<i> this using single-transaction command-line tools, with no other traffic
</I>&gt;<i> going through Squid. Others on this list can guide you as to what
</I>&gt;<i> logging options to use if you do not want to run with ALL,9.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above requires some work on your part. It is a good idea to run
</I>&gt;<i> these tests in a non-production environment (which may require even more
</I>&gt;<i> work from you). Needless to say, you are not required to do that extra
</I>&gt;<i> work. However, some extra work is most likely required if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> get the answer to your question because there is currently not enough
</I>&gt;<i> information to answer it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HTH,
