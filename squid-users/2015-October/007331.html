You just described what HTTP/1.1 revalidation requests do. In your logs
as REFRESH_*. Though they have to send HTTP headers around to get it to
work, which is a little more expensive than the Digest would be, the
result is far more reliable and accurate.


The Cache Digest is just a one-way hash of the URL entries in the cache
index. It is for reducing ICP queries to a peer proxy (ie the frontend
cheap server). If you dont have a cache at both end of the conection it
is not useful. And like ICP it is full of false matches when used with
modern HTTP/1.1.
