</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, here's my theory:  Setup &lt;expensive-server&gt; so that it caches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; EVERYTHING, all of it, and catalogs it with this Digest.  It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expire anything, ever, the only way something gets released from that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cache is when the drive starts running out of room.  It's digest is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then sent to &lt;cheap-server&gt;, which doesn't cache ANYTHING, NOTHING.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When a request comes through from a client, &lt;Expensive-Server&gt; checks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the refresh rules, and if it isn't too stale it gets served just like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does now, but if it IS expired, it then asks &lt;Cheap-Server&gt; &quot;hey,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how expired is this?&quot; and &lt;Cheap-Server&gt; (which has all the bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it could ever want) grabs the content, and digests it.  If the digest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the new retrieval matches something in the digest sent by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;expensive-server&gt;, then &lt;cheap-server&gt; sends up a message that says
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;it's still fresh, the content was written by lazy people or idiots, carry on&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You just described what HTTP/1.1 revalidation requests do. In your logs as
</I>&gt;<i> REFRESH_*. Though they have to send HTTP headers around to get it to
</I>&gt;<i> work, which is a little more expensive than the Digest would be, the result is
</I>&gt;<i> far more reliable and accurate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Cache Digest is just a one-way hash of the URL entries in the cache
</I>&gt;<i> index. It is for reducing ICP queries to a peer proxy (ie the frontend cheap
</I>&gt;<i> server). If you dont have a cache at both end of the conection it is not useful.
</I>&gt;<i> And like ICP it is full of false matches when used with modern HTTP/1.1.

What I'm hearing is, there are facilities for handling that already, don't crack open digest*.cc anytime soon :)

Thank you Amos, both for the response, and for years of diligent effort.  I have probably read hundreds if not thousands of your responses now, your efforts are appreciated by a quiet mob of people scratching their head in the wilderness.  I have other questions, but they're unrelated, I'll let this thread go.
