Each version you go to over 3.1 has different SSL-Bump design needed.
Other than that the last major pain was the jump to 3.2 when helper
renaming happened.

Also, We've done a lot more work over the recent series to make
migrating versions a lot less trouble than ever before. So the more
recent you go the less total pain will be involved.


&gt;<i> Do you know where can I have step by step guide or something related.
</I>
We dont have a step-by-step guide. How you do it depends on how you
previously installed Squid, what you are using it for, what your
abilities are, etc.

In general;

1) make install the newer version over or alongside the old version, but
don't run it

2) run &quot;squid -k parse&quot; using the new squid binary and fix anything in
squid.conf it labels as FATAL or ERROR. Without these fixed the new
Squid will not run.

3) also fix as many of the warnings and other issues it mentions as you can.

4) start the new proxy, and monitor for a while to see if unexpected
problems appear


If you have a vendor packaging Squid for you the first step is whatever
they require. They should take care of most of the upgrade and you are
just left with making sure the config file is updated. Sometimes they
take care of that too.


As I mentioned above upgrades crossing Squid-3.2 had their helper
binaries renamed. So see the Squid-3.2 release notes for details on what
the new names are. You will need to edit squid.conf for those if nothing
else.
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/RELEASENOTES.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/RELEASENOTES.html</A>&gt;


If you have the time it is usually a good idea to look over the release
notes of the new versions you are going to and/or skipping over. We have
added a lot of features aimed at making Squid easier to use. You may
find you can simplify your systems somewhat.
