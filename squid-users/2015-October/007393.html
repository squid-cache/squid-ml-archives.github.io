The Host header verification happens as the first step of message
processing before anything else. So it should not be the cause, but a
side effect of something else.

I think a worse problem is if the DNS TTL is shorter than a client
connections TCP connected time. Then requests arriving after the DNS TTL
expired would no longer match the initial dst-IP.

As a workaround you could try to reduce the client_idle_pconn_timeout
(2mins) then if that does not help the client_lifetime (24hrs).

It will probably require patching to get a full fix. I've started
thinking of solutions. Maybe remembering Host names used on the
connection, or closing it ASAP after the DNS TTL runs out.

&gt;<i> which is only frustrating because caching big updates would be a huge

</I>&gt;<i> Since the proxy on the slow system is requesting the same object, I'm

</I>&gt;<i> that works out.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know that installing bind would probably not be much of a trouble and I
