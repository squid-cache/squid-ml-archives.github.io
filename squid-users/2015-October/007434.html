Are these <A HREF="https://">https://</A> traffic arriving to the proxy in the form of CONNECT
requests?

Or regular <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URLs arriving as GET method?

Is a POST or PUT method request involved with the fetch or just prior?

Is there an unusual port being used?

Or an OPTIONS request happening for some reason?

Nod. As long as you do not use &quot;ssl-bump&quot; on any http_port or https_port
bumping will not happen.

I'm also a bit suspicious in these situations that it might have
something to do with the network IP-range the clients are on vs the
uplink being used.

Is it breaking only when Squid is in the &quot;other&quot; datacenter from the
client(s) ?

Is one datacenter IPv6-enabled but not the other ?


You could possibly set &quot;debug_options ALL,0 17,4&quot; to track the Squid
outbound message forwarding and see what appears to be going on when it
is connecting out for that domain.
