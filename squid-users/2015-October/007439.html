<PRE>Amos,

Thanks for the reply, I apologize if this doesn't come through correctly as
gmail doesn't seem to be parsing the list emails properly.

Are these <A HREF="https://">https://</A> traffic arriving to the proxy in the form of CONNECT
&gt;<i> requests?
</I>&gt;<i> Or regular <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URLs arriving as GET method?
</I>&gt;<i> Is a POST or PUT method request involved with the fetch or just prior?
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an unusual port being used?
</I>&gt;<i> Or an OPTIONS request happening for some reason?
</I>

It looks like the vast majority of the requests are arriving as CONNECT
requests, looking like the traffic is already https, I don't see any POST,
PUT or OPTIONS appearing in the logs.

I'm also a bit suspicious in these situations that it might have
&gt;<i> something to do with the network IP-range the clients are on vs the
</I>&gt;<i> uplink being used.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it breaking only when Squid is in the &quot;other&quot; datacenter from the
</I>&gt;<i> client(s) ?
</I>&gt;<i> Is one datacenter IPv6-enabled but not the other ?
</I>
We haven't tried a large scale test of the proxy from the working
datacenter, that is an option. The outbound IP will be different from
each datacenter, but I can drive out to the other location and see if
that makes a difference accessing it from the other direction. Neither
datacenter has IPv6 turned on.

You could possibly set &quot;debug_options ALL,0 17,4&quot; to track the Squid
&gt;<i> outbound message forwarding and see what appears to be going on when it
</I>&gt;<i> is connecting out for that domain.
</I>
I'll check that option out as well and see if I get any more usable information.


Thanks for the response!
