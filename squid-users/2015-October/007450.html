<PRE>Hi Eliezer,

First, THANK YOU for packaging squid for CentOS 7! I actually reused your
SRPM for my squid 3.5.x builds, just changed a few options :)

About the issue itself.
&gt;<i> Couple questions?
</I>&gt;<i> Are you running\using ssl-bump or not?
</I>
No, not at all, it should just be set to &quot;none&quot;


&gt;<i> When a client request is being aborted what do you see in the squid
</I>&gt;<i> access.log?
</I>
All I've been seeing is CONNECT messages for the facebook URIs,
nothing in the logs that indicates a failure

 From what I know facebook works in HTTPS and an abort can be mainly
&gt;<i> because of a network issue or application level issue.
</I>&gt;<i> Since I am working with squid 3.5.10 and I do not have this issue with
</I>&gt;<i> ssl-bump ON or OFF it is unclear what is causing the issue.
</I>
It is very unclear, our network team is trying to determine if a
network issue may be in play, but we believe that is unlikely...

I couldn't understand how you ran the tests.
&gt;<i> I do understand that you have two proxies and one is peering to the
</I>&gt;<i> other, right?
</I>
Apologies if that wasn't clear, I'll try to give a better explanation:

   - There is always one proxy in this situation.
   - The difference is that we run the proxy out of our secondary
   datacenter and route all user internet traffic through that location so it
   doesn't cause any issues with the traffic to our website flowing in and out
   of our primary datacenter.
   - A test instance I used to recreate the squid instance that is having
   the issues with, works as expected in our primary datacenter, however, the
   older version of squid we were using is located in the secondary datacenter
   and also works as expected, only the newer version doesn't work.


Thanks for your help!
