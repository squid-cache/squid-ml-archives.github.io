30% is too low hit ratio to have cached proxy in infrastructure. There
is simple no reason to cache anything with low hit. It's enough to buy
more external throuthput. Agree?

Yes, I use 3.4.x version with custom settings. It seems safe enough for
my clients, and I have no complains about sites functionality. Sure, I
have exceptions, which is completely no cache. But remain part works good.

Also good tuned cache has another indicator - relatively low disk cache
growing (in addition to high hit ratio). This means that de-duplication
with store-ID works effectively and refresh_patterns are adequate.

And, finally, minimum user complains is a good enough indicator.
