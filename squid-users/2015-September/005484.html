Yes, I read that paragraph before posting. It supports what I have said:
The intended use is different, but there is nothing prohibiting an
origin server from supporting CONNECTs [to arbitrary addresses]. What is
not prohibited is allowed.


&gt;<i> Even if we did accept/200 it; the only valid connections are those going

</I>
Why only to self? And why do you think the server notion of &quot;self&quot; may
not include an address different from the destination address of the
current connection? It is up to the server to allow or deny tunnels [to
various addresses].


&gt;<i> which is port 80 thus plain text HTTP. 
</I>
CONNECT may be received inside an SSL/TLS connection as well, but this
does not really matter for this discussion.

Alex.
