I have a suggestion which I hope may help - show us a configuration you have 
tried, following the documentation, and tell us in what way it fails to work 
as expected - then we may be able to show you where the error is.

It's quite significant that in your original question, you did not mention you 
were using Squid in transparent SSL Bump mode, therefore the answer you 
received did not take this into account.

The more information you give us about what you want to achieve, what you've 
done so far, and what goes wrong, the more we are able to help you debug the 
problem.


Regards,


Antony.

I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way 
is to make it so simple that there are _obviously_ no deficiencies, and the 
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no _obvious_ 
deficiencies.
