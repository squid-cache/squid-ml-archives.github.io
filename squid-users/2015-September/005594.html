Correct.


&gt;<i> 2. some important websites shouldn't be bumped - like banking or payment

</I>
Whether some sites should or should not be bumped is a local policy
decision. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The
specifics of that local policy may affect _when_ you splice those
important sites (if any) or, in other words, _how_ you identify those
important sites.


&gt;<i> 3. some websites/services can't  be bumped because of HPKP feature. So
</I>&gt;<i> if we want to allow users to use such sites/services we must splice it
</I>
Or, if you can reinstall all browsers from scratch, you can
overwrite/delete site's Public-Key-Pins headers when bumping. HPKP is a
Trust on First Use feature so you can essentially disable it if you
control that &quot;first use&quot;. Please note that I am not an expert on this --
I am just reading Mozilla's description of the feature at
<A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning</A>

There are other reasons a site may not support bumping. You will need to
babysit your bumping Squid to make sure your users are as happy as can
be expected.


&gt;<i> at step 2 (like banking systems)?
</I>
The best timing (i.e., the step number) for splicing depends on many
local factors.


&gt;<i> My policy is: bump everything except banking systems (and some other
</I>&gt;<i> important domains):  My config is like this:
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> acl nobumpSites ssl::server_name &quot;/etc/squid3/allowed_SSL_sites.txt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump peek step1
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump splice step2 nobumpSites
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump bump all
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------
</I>
I do not see the reason for the &quot;step2&quot; ACL in the above. Do you?


&gt;<i> So tell me what's the reason of peeking at step1 ? I suppose getting the
</I>&gt;<i> real server_name based on SNI instead of reading it from CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> request?  (remember: all browsers are proxy aware)
</I>
Yes. Not all CONNECT requests have host names.


&gt;<i> I'm asking because when I change my configuration to this one:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> acl allowed_https_sites dstdomain &quot;/etc/squid3/allowed_SSL_sites.txt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump splice allowed_https_sites
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump bump all
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to work the same way.
</I>
Have you tested both configurations using a CONNECT request with an IP
address? Have you tested with a CONNECT request for a foo.example.com
domain when that domain responds with a bar.example.com certificate?

If not, your testing is not good enough to expose [at least two]
differences between the two configurations.


&gt;<i> Is  'ssl::server_name' more reliable than 'dstdomain'?
</I>
&quot;reliable&quot; is an undefined term in this context.

ssl::server_name may use SNI (where available). Dstdomain does not know
about SNI. There are other important documented differences as well:

&gt;<i> The server name is obtained during Ssl-Bump steps from such sources
</I>&gt;<i> as CONNECT request URI, client SNI, and SSL server certificate CN.
</I>&gt;<i> During each Ssl-Bump step, Squid may improve its understanding of a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;true server name&quot;. Unlike dstdomain, this ACL does not perform
</I>&gt;<i> DNS lookups.
</I>


&gt;<i> So, despite that I'm still confused about peek &amp; stare -  for me
</I>&gt;<i> it makes only sense in this order
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. peek everything at step 1 (to get reliable server name by SNI ???)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. splicing exceptions (&quot;whitelist&quot;) at step 2
</I>&gt;<i> 3. stare all at step 2  (or just bump the rest at step 2)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. bump all at step 3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> does it make sense according to my policy assumptions?
</I>
It depends how you want to identify whitelisted sites. For example, if
you want to validate the server certificate before splicing, then the
above will not work.


&gt;<i> what's the advantage of stare at step 2 - instead of
</I>&gt;<i> bumping everything after splicing the exceptions?
</I>
I am not sure, but it is possible that bumping at step 2 will not mimic
some server certificate features in the future (it does now). For a
related discussion, please see
