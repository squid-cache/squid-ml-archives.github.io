If you define &quot;content&quot; as &quot;information that a browser may show to a
regular user&quot;, then you have to filter all [responses with] bodies,
authentication-requesting responses (for their realm strings),
certificate names, certificate issuer names, and possibly other things
that browser may display to the user.

And if you add dynamic Javascript-driven pages, there is pretty much
nothing you can reliably filter on the &quot;content&quot; level because the
offensive page may be assembled from non-offensive and/or encrypted parts.

Request methods have pretty much nothing to do with the above.


&gt;<i> A PUT request can contain a response body but it is not used and was not

</I>&gt;<i> implement support for it.
</I>
I doubt the above is correct -- I would expect the browser to show PUT
responses to the user -- but this is not my area of expertise.


&gt;<i> So after defining that the main subject as abusive content in the body
</I>&gt;<i> part of the message, POST and GET are a must to check but OPTIONS might
</I>&gt;<i> not be required.
</I>
I see no logical connection from &quot;the main subject [is] content in the
body&quot; and &quot;[checking] OPTIONS [bodies] might not be required&quot;. Since
OPTIONS responses may have a body, and you said that you want to block
abusive content in the body, it seems logical to filter OPTIONS.
