And this lack of information is unlikely to be resolved in the
foreseeable future because most of those who are doing the pinning
probably do not want to make bumping safer or, better, unnecessary. They
want to make it impractical or impossible.

Judging by the level of fanaticism of some of the primary players in the
area, and the increasing level of control they currently enjoy over the
&quot;web&quot;, things will continue to overall worsen for the bumping crowd,
despite our efforts to make bumping safer.

Alex.
