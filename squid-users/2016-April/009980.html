That does not make sense. Intercepting and URL-rewriting are completely
different actions.

The Squid-3.5 and later versions are able to receive PROXY protocol
headers from HAProxy. You may find that much better than fiddling around
with URLs and available in your current HAProxy.

What restriction?


&gt;<i> what mechanisms can i use to identify the fact that the client traffic

Only the interceptor can do that traffic distinction. Once traffic gets
multiplexed the information is lost.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> options?  how are other folks dealing with intercepted and explicit
</I>&gt;<i> traffic on the same box?
</I>
That would be one fairly good way to distinguish the traffic types. So
why is the URL fiddling happening?
