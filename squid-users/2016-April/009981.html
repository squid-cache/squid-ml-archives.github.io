<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I'm attempting to build a transparent proxy (policy based routing on
firewall to squid proxy) with the following behavior:

1) proxies http traffic for a given set of domains, provide an message
otherwise such &quot;domain not allowed&quot; or similar
2) proxies https traffic for a given set of domains (ideally, splicing
those, so as not to break HSTS, if enabled), otherwise provide an error
message (bumping and providing &quot;domain not allowed&quot;)

I'm attempting this with a 3.5.15 compiled with icap (not yet used) and
ssl-bumping.

Part 1 seems easy enough (and is well documented)...

acl whitelist dstdomain .domain1.tld
acl whitelist dstdomain .domain2.tld

acl http_ok all-of whitelist !SSL_ports

http_access allow http_ok
http_access deny all

Moving onto Part 2 (the peek and splice setup) appears to be the topic of a
few discussions out there...

acl sni_whitelist ssl::server_name .domain1.tld
acl sni_whitelist ssl::server_name .domain2.tld

ssl_bump peek step1
ssl_bump splice sni_whitelist
ssl_bump bump all

It appears however that when combining the two, the generated
certificate(s), instead of mimic'ing the original server's certificate
comes out with the CN=&lt;IP&gt; where &lt;IP&gt; is the ip used by the &quot;connect&quot; part
of the connection. In addition, it appears that only the first entry ever
matches (at this point, i've tried so many combinations, i'm no longer
certain of anything).

If i remove *all* the http_access lines, then the behavior appears correct
(from a &quot;splicing/bumping&quot; standpoint).

Can anyone confirm that this is indeed possible to achieve?

I believe, based on experimentation that any http_access i have, because of
the &quot;deny all&quot; cause the bumping to &quot;short circuit&quot; and effectively send an
early &quot;access denied&quot; based on the only information it has (the ip address
from the &quot;connect&quot;, rather than the SNI that would come later).

Would a setup where &quot;deny http+!whitelist&quot; so have the allow be the default
allow for the bumping to work and get to step2 and match the sni* acls
somehow? (with a &quot;deny step2 !sni_whitelist&quot;).

Is 3.5.15 capable of doing this? If this requires some feature/effort, what
would be the procedure to sponsor that work?

Thanks,
Jok
