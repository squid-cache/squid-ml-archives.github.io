NP: Messages sent at 12am should be expected to have some response
delay. (and its always 12am somewhere in the world :-).

Huh?

aria2c is a &quot;client&quot; (or &quot;user agent&quot;) in HTTP terminology.

A proxy is ... a proxy. Which is to say both client and server. But
definitely NOT a user-agent.

So either you have written a proxy, or you have written something like
aria2c. Not both.

&quot;accelerator&quot; is a marketing jargon word. Particularly when used in the
phrase &quot;download acclerator&quot;.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Terminology clash again. Squid does not send files anywhere. Two reasons
for that:

1) HTTP is a &quot;pull&quot; protocol: Requests go out (aka &quot;send&quot;). Responses
come back (aka &quot;receive&quot;). That is all.

2) HTTP has therefore no protocol concept of &quot;files&quot;. Squid is only
aware of the response content-type (note that its &quot;payload&quot; or
&quot;content&quot;, not 'file') when it is already on its way back to the client.
Far too late to decide which server to send the request message to.


I *think* what you are asking for is:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer_access/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer_access/</A>&gt;

But I am seriously doubting whether you have the right HTTP model with
all this malformed terminology you are using.

You can approximately guess what the traffic will be by urlpath_regex
matching the URL path values. But unless you control the servers URL
design that is just a rough guess.


PS. &quot;download accelerator&quot; is an old concept from the days 20-odd years
go when networks were slow and HTTP/1.0 was wasting bandwidth to make
things slower. As with all old concepts in HTTP Squid probably already
does it in one way or several.
In particular modern HTTP/1.1 plus Caching obsoletes almost all
&quot;download accelerator&quot; designs in a much more efficient way.
 If you describe what you actualy want the whole system to do in a clear
way we can perhapse provide you with squid.conf settings to avoid
needing the extra layer of custom proxy software.
