FYI: each of the Squid 3.2 -&gt; 4.0 series so far have had significantly
different TLS handling code. So commments about one series are unlikely
to be relevant to the others, particularly in regards to SSL-Bump
functionality.

This is one of the things that is currently still being sorted out. In
some cases the current releases should just send the certs, in some it
should not, in others it should but doesn't. So YMMV.

The patch that just went in today sounds to me like what you are
needing. So you might want to try the Squid-4.0.8 with this extra patch
(&lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-14626.patch">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-14626.patch</A>&gt;) or
a 4.0 daily snapshot rev.14626 (or later) when it becomes available.
