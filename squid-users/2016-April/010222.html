The most technical you can get is to read the code itself. Second best
would be &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>&gt;.

</I>
Odd. Neither OpenSSL nor Squid produce a message saying that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My second question I think is a quickie.  Can you run 2 log files?
</I>&gt;<i> Reason being is that I use squidanalyzer and it only reads the

</I>&gt;<i> that reads that log file.   You can see the logformat line commented
</I>&gt;<i> out along with some other log  lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes. Just put multiple access_log lines in. One for each file/output you
want.
