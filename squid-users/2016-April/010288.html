</I>
&quot;splice&quot; comes from a standard networking technique of &quot;TCP splicing&quot;
which is exactly what Squid is trying to do when the &quot;splice&quot; action wins.

&quot;bump&quot; comes from a more-or-less standard networking concept of &quot;bump in
the wire&quot; that describes temporary elevating processing to the next
protocol level. In Squid's case, we are temporary elevating processing
from SSL to HTTP level.

&quot;peek&quot; comes from the English verb &quot;to peek&quot; which means &quot;look quickly&quot;
and has such synonyms as &quot;take a stealthy look&quot;, which is exactly what
Squid is trying to do when the &quot;peek&quot; action wins.

&quot;stare&quot; comes from the English verb &quot;to stare&quot; and was chosen as a kind
of antonym to &quot;to peek&quot;. When Squid stares at the SSL exchanges, it may
modify things and generally prepare connections for bumping, which is a
much longer operation compared to peeking.

There is also &quot;terminate&quot; which does what it says.


In my biased opinion, the action names are actually pretty accurate and
descriptive. My only regret is that the feature itself was called SSL
_Bump_ and not something more action-neutral. Unfortunately, I did not
predict the necessary for more actions when we started writing bumping code.

Alex.
