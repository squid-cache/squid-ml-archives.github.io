Perhapse on CPU a little. The memory defaults have been raised since
even most embeded systems have more than a few MB available now. The
buffering memory usage is about the same in Squid-2 and Squid-3 though,
maybe smaller even. Unless you are using ICAP in which case it doubles
the buffer memory requirements.

For embeded systems you will want to tune cache_mem downwards quite a
bit. The default is 256MB with no disk cache. Compared to Squid-2 with
32MB of memory cache and 100MB of disk.

&quot;seems to&quot; being the operative words. I think you will find that leaving
them active, but tweaking the timeouts will have better results than
fully disabling.
The browser guys (and we) are actively pushing for persistence since it
does measurably reduce latency/delay overheads.
