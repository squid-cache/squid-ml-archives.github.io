<PRE>Thanks for your patience with this, but still not quite getting it.

I thought there were two cases:

  1) Client drops the connection before the interaction is complete ==
     log shows HTTP result code 000, almost always size 0 as well;

  2) Interaction completed successfully == HTTP result code as from
     cache or remote, size as sent to client.

See below how I can't make that fit with your reply

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  2) Leaving aside those cases, I see a modest handful (1 in 7000) of 0

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     1402741879.726 114 ... TCP_MISS/200 0 GET <A HREF="http://...">http://...</A> DIRECT/... image/gif
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     1402771557.693 176 ... TCP_HIT/200 0 GET <A HREF="http://...">http://...</A> NONE/- image/gif
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     How should these be understood?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A response with no body payload. It happens. Usually with &quot;web bug&quot; type
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> images used for tracking.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or maybe the image was something like a captcha and the script producing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it crashed with no data sent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But documentation claims size field includes headers, and clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (image/gif) at least a Content-type header was sent...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. The reply message header (maybe more, or not) was received from
</I>&gt;<i> the server but not sent to the client. The second case it only got as
</I>&gt;<i> far as loading from disk and not yet sending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the lowest level it was likely the attempt to write(2) those reply
</I>&gt;<i> details to the client that detected the connection was closed/aborted
</I>&gt;<i> already by the other end.
</I>
So the simple story I added at the top is wrong, and I should instead
understand that

  1') Log shows size 0 means client dropped the connection before the
      interaction was complete (HTTP result code 000 vs. something else is
      just a question of when the drop was detected);

  2) Interaction completed successfully == HTTP result code as from
     cache or remote, size as sent to client.  0 size can _never_ mean
     all is well, server result was empty, because if all is well at
     least some header info will have been sent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  3) I'm seeing very small numbers (1 in 100000) of negative durations, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     1402744620.389 -70 ... TCP_MISS/200 1882 GET <A HREF="http://...">http://...</A> DIRECT/... text/xml
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     How should these be understood?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The system clock on your machine went backwards between the request
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arriving and the response being completely sent. Check for issues in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your NTP setup.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1000s of times a day?  Seems . . . unlikely.  But I'll try to get the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sys admin people responsible to investigate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Squid's simply doing a time fetch from the kernel and subtracting
</I>&gt;<i> Start-time from End-time to get a negative.
</I>&gt;<i> Note that its on the scale of ~100 milliseconds.
</I>
Sorry but I still don't see how two successive fetchs could result in a
decrement (w/o an NTP intervention).  

The negative numbers I'm seeing range up into the low 1000s (of msec,
right?  That's what the squid documentation says, IIRC).

Did you really mean &quot;~100 _milliseconds_&quot;?  My understanding was that
kernel time differences were typically accurate to ~100 _nanoseconds_.

If you can easily tell me where to look in the source, obviously that's
what I should do....
