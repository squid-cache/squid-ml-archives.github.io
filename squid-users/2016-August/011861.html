</I>I enabled logLevel 2 for all squid facilities, but so far I didn't
fugura out any pattern from log. The only thing I noticed - is that for
large download the Recv-Q value reported by the netstat for a particular
squid-to-server connection is extremely high, so is the Send-Q value for
a connection from squid to client. I don't know if it's a cause or a
consequence, but from my point of view this may indicate that buffers
are overflown for some reason, I think this may cause, in turn, RSTs and
connection closing - am I right ?. I still don't know whether it's a
squid fault of may be it's local OS misconfiguration.

Eugene.
