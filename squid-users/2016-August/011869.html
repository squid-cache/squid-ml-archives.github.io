If you find this tutorial difficult to follow, I would suggest your best option 
is to try a different one, which may have been written more clearly for 
beginners to understand.

&gt;<i> Here is my squid.conf file: <A HREF="https://ghostbin/paste/kw7pp.">https://ghostbin/paste/kw7pp.</A>
</I>
That URL does not work for me.

In any case, if you have questions for the list, it would be *far* better if 
you were to put your squid.conf file, without comments or blank lines (I assume 
you do know how to use grep to remove these, if you are trying to set up 
something like Squid), into the body of your emails, so that we can reply to 
specific parts of your setup, and the results can easily be seen in the list 
archives for anyone in future who has the same problems as you do.

My best guidance for you at the moment, though, is to look for the following 
line in your squid.conf file:

# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS

and insert the lines your tutorial tells you add immediately after that.

Once you have done that, if you continue to encounter problems, please post 
your resulting squid.conf file (without comments or blank lines) here and tell 
us exactly what the problem was.  We may then be able to help further.


Regards,


Antony.
