In that case you are editing the wrong file.

Please answer my question &quot;Where on your system is the squid.conf file which 
you are using?&quot;

&gt;<i> and it also have line:  INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW

&gt;<i> No, i not still not tried adding the lines containined in the tutorial you

</I>
Add the lines immediately after the line &quot;INSERT YOUR OWN...&quot; (as I said in a 
previous reply).

However, please answer my question &quot;Where on your system is the squid.conf file 
which you are using?&quot;

&gt;<i> and it also have step 3 in tutorial, anonymizing traffic, i don't know how to
</I>&gt;<i> do this.
</I>
Don't worry about step three until you have steps 1 and 2 correctly working.


Incidentally, I cannot help feeling that you are not going to achieve what you 
appear to want.  You keep on talking of anonymizing your traffic, and you 
previously asked how to change your IP address...

I am assuming that your Squid server is either:

1. on your own network, on an Internet connection registered to you

or

2. hosted by a provider on a machine registered to you

or

3. hosted on some cloud service running under an account registered to you

Therefore in all three cases, requests sent to remote websites by your Squid 
server will be traceable in the remote server logs to your account and 
therefore you.

The &quot;anonymizing&quot; steps in the tutorial you are trying to follow will hide the 
IP address of your client machine, but not that of your Squid server.


Best wishes,

Antony.
