You are getting really annoying.

We ask you to post your squid.conf file here - you keep on putting it onto 
pastebin.

We ask you to copy error messages into the body of your emails - you keep 
sending us incomplete screenshots.

We suggest that you put the configuration lines you are trying to add to your 
squid.conf immediately after the line which says &quot;INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE 
TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS&quot; (which, to be honest, I think should be 
self-explanatory in itself that that is where you should be putting them), and 
you come back and ask multiple times &quot;where do I put them?&quot;

And by the way, I hope that the IP address 12.34.56.78 was just an example, 
and isn't the real IP address of your client machine (or do you in fact work 
for the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
which is who that IP address belongs to?).


Please show us any indication that you have attempted to do something for 
yourself, rather than just asking us to create your squid.conf file for you.


If you are unable to follow guidance such as I wrote to you yesterday:

-----
My best guidance for you at the moment, though, is to look for the following 
line in your squid.conf file:

# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS

and insert the lines your tutorial tells you add immediately after that.

Once you have done that, if you continue to encounter problems, please post 
your resulting squid.conf file (without comments or blank lines) here and tell 
us exactly what the problem was.  We may then be able to help further.
-----

then I'm not sure we are able to help you in any way at all.


Regards,


Antony.
