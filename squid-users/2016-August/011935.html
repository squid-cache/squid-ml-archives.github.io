The following two lines exit in your squid.conf:

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
http_port 3128

&gt;<i> where is port 3128 come from?
</I>
That is the standard port number which squid uses for client (ie: browser) 
connections.

&gt;<i> Is ip-address that i will configure in browser is ip in : acl homepc
</I>&gt;<i> src 12.34.56.78?
</I>
No.

Firstly, you must tell the browser to connect to the IP address of your squid 
proxy.

You can probably find out what this is by typing &quot;/sbin/ifconfig&quot; at a shell 
prompt on your squid server.


Secondly, you must tell the squid proxy to allow connections from the IP 
address of your client machine (ie: the one the browser is running on).


I have told you at least twice already that 12.34.56.78 is an EXAMPLE - it 
WILL NOT WORK until you change it to the actual IP address of YOUR client 
machine.

Nobody here can tell you what the IP address of YOUR squid proxy and YOUR 
client machine are, because we did not set up your network.  You need to know 
how your own network is organised before you can get something like squid 
working.

We do not even know what sort of machine you are using for your client (is it 
Linux? Mac OS? Windows? Android?) so we cannot even give you clues about 
finding out this information about your own network if you do not yet know.
