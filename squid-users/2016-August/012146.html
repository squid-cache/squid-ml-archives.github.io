Yes, that is all the OP is looking for.

Once it leaves the OP's network I suspect the risk (of eavesdropping etc) is 
reduced.

I do not think the browser will show an SSL/TLS padlock for a secured proxy 
connection - it only shows this for a secured connection to the destination 
server.  Therefore no misled users.

&gt;<i> believes all secure connection - as external traffic is not encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> after the fact. Second. You seriously think that the world will sit

</I>
I don't understand what you are saying here.

The connection across the local network between browser and proxy is secured.

Beyond that everything works across the Internet just as normal - HTTP sites 
are not secured, HTTPS sites are secured.  The user sees SSL padlock and 
certificate chain for HTTPS sites, nothing for HTTP sites.

So, the design is more secure over the local network than the standard 
arrangement, and exactly the same beyond the local network.

No security is being compromised or downgraded.

Douglas was one of those writers who honourably failed to get anywhere with 
'weekending'.  It put a premium on people who could write things that lasted 
thirty seconds, and Douglas was incapable of writing a single sentence that 
lasted less than thirty seconds.
