What is this &quot;SSL split&quot; you speak of?

Squid does not support SFTP as far as I am aware except by CONNECT
tunnelling done by the client. Which is difficult since (S)FTP has
several TCP connections going in different directions at once.

&gt;<i> We occasionally see ERR_CONNECT_FAIL with SYSERR=110.
</I>
TCP connection setup failed. Whatever your operating system means by the
&quot;110&quot; message is the reason why.

If you mean the SNMP  OID *.1.3.1.2.0 (aka cacheSysNumReads). Which is
described as &quot;HTTP I/O number of reads&quot;.

It is the counter of how many system read(2) I/O operations that have
been done for HTTP traffic. Being a counter, it will only ever go up.

&gt;<i> I am not able to understand this value - what it points to. Sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> the value of HTTP I/O number of reads jump from tenths to 6000 or even
</I>&gt;<i> higher.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Since you imply that you are proxying CONNECT tunnels containing entire
SFTP transactions. It would be reasonable to expect a lot of read
operations to happen for them. Both the 'S' and the 'FTP' layers each
have a lot of small messages going back and forth through the tunnel.


You might also be having bug 2907. Which is fixed in Squid-3.5. Please
try an upgrade.
