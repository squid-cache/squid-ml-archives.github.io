Your access.log can show that. It shows up as the server the transaction
is being sent to being port 3128/3129 on 127.0.0.1 or another IP
assigned to the Squid machine.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> misconfiguration - or is this portion of the code not working with
</I>&gt;<i> OSX.

It has been a long time since anyone using MacOS has provided any
particular feedback about Squid behaviour on MacOS. So it could be just
bugs when running on MacOS.


&gt;<i> I looked at the code for mitmproxy, and it seems like they
</I>&gt;<i> require a sudoers entry to run &quot;pfctl -s state&quot; and parse the state.
</I>&gt;<i> Would something like that need to be added to squid to support

Squid (when built with the /dev/pf support) master process which is run
as root [you are running Squid from the root account right?] should be
preserving its permission to access the device before it drops down to
low privilege levels for handling the network traffic.

Some other troubleshooting things to try:

* using the machines public IP addres instead of 127.0.0.1. There are
hardware or driver level restrictions on locahost addresses that often
prohibit that type of NAT.

* using a divert-to rule instead of rdr. If your PF firewall accepts
that and the 'tproxy' option in squid.conf works then the /dev/pf is not
relevant. rdr sometimes does not work when divert-to is fine.

* check the PF version in your MacOS. If it derives from OpenBSD 4.8 or
later then the .dev.pf is not relevant - rdr/divert-to failure is then a
bug somewhere AFAIK.
