SMP Squid is usually the correct way to deploy a single Squid on a
single beefy machine. &quot;Multiple instances&quot; is the correct way to host
multiple/different/independent Squids on a single machine. In some
cases, multiple Squid instances include SMP Squid instances! The two
features are essentially orthogonal.

Multiple Squid instances are also used (and abused) as a workaround for
various current SMP Squid limitations, which is where the confusion is
often coming from. If you think of a high-level description of what you
want to do, treating Squid as a black box &quot;proxy&quot;, then you should be
able to classify your particular use case as a &quot;ideally, a single Squid&quot;
or &quot;multiple/different/independent Squids&quot; and go from there.

[ If you know Apache web server (httpd), then temporary consider
thinking of Squid as an Apache web server configured to proxy traffic.
Does your environment require multiple Apache servers or a single one?
Similar to Squid, Apache supports SMP scale, but that is a _secondary_
question. ]

Some of the current SMP Squid limitations are important and do require
either workarounds or development, but &quot;multiple instance&quot; propaganda
often comes from folks who do not understand SMP or have non-technical
phobias/biases against it. Often, those folks are far more vocal than
those who understand what is going on, so it is easy to get the wrong
impression that &quot;multiple instances&quot; is &quot;more recent&quot; or &quot;the future&quot;.

SMP Squid is gradually getting better, with fewer exceptions that
require workarounds, including workarounds that involve multiple
instances. Multiple instances support is also getting better. Again,
each orthogonal feature targets a completely different problem area.

The above summary was true for several years, and I expect it to remain
accurate for the foreseeable future.


Sorry, I cannot provide detailed answers to your other good questions
right now.


HTH,

Alex.
