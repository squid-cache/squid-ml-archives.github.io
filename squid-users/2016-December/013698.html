<PRE>hey squid users .

i want just to share  a small stuff  .

i always see many people suffer from problems of https pump with some websites .

and in the same time i see that they are not interested with caching of https .

so all what they need is they just let HTTP &amp; HTTPS as transparent .

so i just want to share about &#8220;redsocks&#8221; tool and using it to catch up https and forward it to other squid  server using &#8220;TCP_connect &#8220; METHOD .

so yes .. u already pump the http without problems.

but if u feel u have headache with ssl pump ?? &#8230; u can use redsocks  and from redsocks forward it to squid again using &#8220;tcp_connect &#8220;


i hope this  is helpful for some .


Kind regards 

Ahmad Alzaeem
