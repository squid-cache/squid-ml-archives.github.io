Such a bug is somewhat unlikely but any bug is possible. More
information is needed to confirm or deny the bug itself (and one of your
explanations why it exists).

Sorry, that was not it. That quoted v3.5 debugging log does not appear
to have [enough] HTTP information. It is mostly about your Squid talking
to your ICAP service. The v3.4 log was better, but I do not really care
much about v3.4.

Here is what I meant:

* Packet trace is a binary file in libpcap format. Usually produced by
tools like tcpdump or Wireshark. We need traffic from/to Squid (two TCP
connections, four directions). Some of that traffic may be encrypted.
This option works well, at least as a starting point, if Squid forwards
the CONNECT request (or an intercepted SSL connection) that it should
deny because those parts are not usually encrypted.

* Squid's HTTP request printouts can be collected by setting
debug_options to ALL,2 and repeating your test. Please limit the
collection to one failing transaction if possible and attach your logs
(or post a link to them).

Whichever approach you use, please do not forget to identify which
packets/requests were incorrectly forwarded and which &quot;http_access deny&quot;
rules they [should have] matched. In other words, you are essentially
claiming that there is a bug. You may be right! Please provide enough
information to support/illustrate your claim so that we can reproduce
and fix the bug if needed.


HTH,

Alex.
