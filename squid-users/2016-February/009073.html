</I>&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:24| Current Directory is /run
</I>
First oddity. A master-level Squid process suddenly initializing (no
'kidN' ID).

&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:24 kid1| Preparing for shutdown after 312 requests
</I>&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:24 kid1| Waiting 30 seconds for active connections to
</I>&gt;<i> finish
</I>
This means an explicit shutdown command has been delivered to the
running Squid service, 'kid1' is obeying.

That could be done via a cachemgr request [not in your case, your
squid.conf does not unlock that action], a system 'kill' signal, or a
'squid -k shutdown' (or -k restart) signal.

Possibly by that other Squid that said &quot;Current Directory is /run&quot;.

OR, possibly by something else and the other one talking in the log is a
new squid process trying to startup (but failing below)


&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:24 kid1| Closing HTTP port [::]:3129
</I>&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:24 kid1| Closing HTTPS port [::]:3130
</I>&gt;<i> 2016/02/09 11:10:26| Squid is already running!  Process ID 30116
</I>
Another squid process is being attempted to be started before the
existing 'kid1' is finished shutting down.

Are you using systemd or upstart? I have seen this type of overlap when
there is a daemon manager watching the &quot;squid -k shutdown&quot; process to
guess when Squid was shutdown. But that process just emits a SIGHUP and
exits ... way, way, way, way faster than the real Squid shutdown time.
 (a whole 29+ seconds faster in this log).

</I>
Squid has some data queued up to be sent on the server connection but
its being held back due to peek or stare action currently taking place.

I suspect its not a major issue, but I'm not sure why its at such a high
debug level. Christos may be able to answer better.

It being told to. See above.
