<PRE>Hey Admin,

I have been working on SquidBlocker for quite some time and have just 
released (about two weeks ago) the latest 1.0.0 as an RPM at:
<A HREF="http://ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/x86_64/squidblocker-1.0.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm">http://ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/x86_64/squidblocker-1.0.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm</A>

I have not tried yet but using alien will result some kind of &quot;OK&quot; deb 
file. If you need some kind of tar or binaries for other 
platforms(everything that Golang compiler supports) I will gladly 
compile them for you.

I have upgraded SquidBlocker with a UI and embedded the ICAP service.
You can see some of the details at: 
<A HREF="http://new.ngtech.co.il/squidblocker_en.html">http://new.ngtech.co.il/squidblocker_en.html</A>

The above page\site is a beta and is far from completion but has the 
basics in it. I didn't described the UI interface since it's very 
simplistic and was built with one thing in mind &quot;functionality&quot;. Anyone 
that can read this mailing list should be able to figure out his way in 
it using a browser.

I am using it here and it works great for me but may not fit for others.
Since your issue is squid long startup time I would recommend you to try 
it. One of the nice things in version 1.0.0 is that I added to the DB 
url testing interface(can be accessed using the UI or even curl) result 
the &quot;HITTING&quot; db key which makes it easy to debug black or white listing 
false positives of domains and urls list.

Let me know if you need anything privately or publicly.
