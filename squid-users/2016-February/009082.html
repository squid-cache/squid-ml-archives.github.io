Just to avoid a misunderstanding:

* MemBlob does not have an &quot;offset&quot;.

* SBuf::off_ should not change when we are adding characters to SBuf
because it is the start of the buffer, not the end of it.

* A call to c_str() should not increase SBuf::len_  either because it
does not add a new character to the SBuf object. That call just
terminates the underlying buffer.

Based on your comments below, I think I know what you mean by &quot;go out of
sync&quot;, but everything is as &quot;in sync&quot; as it can be when one adds
termination characters that are not really there from SBuf::length()
point of view. The bug is elsewhere.


&gt;<i> MemBlob::canAppend() failing because
</I>&gt;<i> MemBlob::isAppendOffset() fails -- the 'off' and 'size' are not the
</I>&gt;<i> same due to the above c_str() call.
</I>
Single-owner optimizations aside (a known TODO), the above is the
desired behavior according to the documented c_str() guarantees:

&gt;<i>      * The returned value points to an internal location whose contents
</I>&gt;<i>      * are guaranteed to remain unchanged only until the next call
</I>&gt;<i>      * to a non-constant member function of the SBuf object.
</I>
In other words, we cannot allow some _other_ SBuf object to overwrite
our null-termination character in the MemBlob we share with that other SBuf.

The high price for that strong guarantee is one of the reasons we should
avoid c_str() calls in Squid code.


&gt;<i> When canAppend() fails, a new
</I>&gt;<i> buffer is re-allocated. When this reallocation occurs, however, the
</I>&gt;<i> new size of the buffer is dependent on the size being reserved.
</I>
If we are still talking about the I/O buffer (and not just some random
SBuf string somewhere), then the I/O buffer _capacity_ should not shrink
below a certain minimum, regardless of how much content the buffer has
already stored. There should be some Squid code that ensures the minimum
capacity of the I/O buffer used to read requests. If it is missing, it
is a Squid bug.


&gt;<i> As a temporary measure, I have an experimental change that checks
</I>&gt;<i> whether the body size is known and if known always reserves a large
</I>&gt;<i> enough size (currently 16K). 
</I>
It is difficult to discuss this without seeing your changes, but the
reservation should probably be unconditional -- the I/O buffer capacity
should always be at least 16KB (or whatever size we start with).


HTH,

Alex.
