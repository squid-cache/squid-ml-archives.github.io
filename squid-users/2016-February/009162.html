<PRE>It's been a while since I've looked at this&#8212;because the software we use to
generate our squid.conf just works around now&#8212;but we found that Squid 3
would only enforce exactly half the configured rate on HTTP requests but
enforce the full rate on HTTPS requests.

So we now make two delay pools for every &quot;restriction&quot;: one for HTTP which
is x2 the byte rate and one for HTTPS which is normal.

I don't we looked much more into it or filed a bug 'cause none of the
developers seem very keen on pushing delay_pools forward, due their being
more robust network-level approaches these days.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NOW.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently upgrade squid to 3.3.8 and I notice that delay pool started to

</I>&gt;<i> Frustrated with this behavior I put different squid versions in a

</I>&gt;<i> squid 3.x versions, today I made a final test and I think that the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of HTTP v1.1 is maybe related with that problem (I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure but tomorow I will make a few tests with squid 3.1 where HTTP v1.1 was
</I>&gt;<i> not yet implemented)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please, if you have the opportunity, just test this in a Lab environment,
</I>&gt;<i> I decided to write to this email list because I asked to many people that
</I>&gt;<i> already have implemented squid as proxy in their networks and they didn't
</I>&gt;<i> believed to me until I demostrated the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have anyone information about this bug? There is any hope to fix this
</I>&gt;<i> problem at code level?
