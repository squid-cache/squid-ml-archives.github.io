<PRE>Hey Martin,

I was wondering if you had the chance of trying to enforce some QOS 
policy on the OS level?
Also what OS and distribution are you using?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frustrated with this behavior I put different squid versions in a

</I>&gt;<i> Please, if you have the opportunity, just test this in a Lab

</I>&gt;<i> networks and they didn't believed to me until I demostrated the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have anyone information about this bug? There is any hope to fix this
