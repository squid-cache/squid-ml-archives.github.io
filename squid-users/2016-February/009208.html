So, does this mean that all browsers and similar clients are unable to access 
any HTTPS resource (since they don't have an explicitly-configured proxy, and 
there's no configuration to support SSL intercept)?

Or do you have some other mechanism (eg: simple Masquerading NAT) to allow 
clients to access the Internet for non-HTTP traffic?

Blocking HTTPS would prevent you being able to access a large proportion of 
today's Internet.

</I>
What are you logging on the firewall?

I'm not familar with Whatsapp myself (I've heard of it, yes, but I don't use 
it).

Is it possible to find out what URL it wants to access when you click on an 
image?

Alternatively, can you use a packet sniffer like wireshark on a router in the 
path between the client and the Internet, to see what it is trying to do?

I would also suggest trying to access some other HTTP and HTTPS resources, to 
see whether there's anything specific to Whatsapp, or whether all HTTPS is 
blocked, or whether it's some other problem.
