Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2016:2
__________________________________________________________________

Advisory ID:        SQUID-2016:1
Date:               February 23, 2016
Summary:            Multiple Denial of Service issues
                    in HTTP Response processing
Affected versions:  Squid 3.x -&gt; 3.5.16
                    Squid 4.x -&gt; 4.0.7
Fixed in version:   Squid 4.0.7, 3.5.15

__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Due to incorrect bounds checking Squid is vulnerable to a denial
 of service attack when processing HTTP responses.

 Due to incorrect error handling Squid-4 is vulnerable to a denial
 of service attack when processing malformed HTTP responses.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 These problems allow remote servers delivering certain unusual
 HTTP response syntax to trigger a denial of service for all
 clients accessing the Squid service.

 HTTP responses containing malformed headers that trigger this
 issue are becoming common. We are not certain at this time if
 that is a sign of malware or just broken server scripting.

 Details of a trivial attack are already circulating publicly.

__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

 These bugs are fixed by Squid version 3.5.15 and 4.0.7.

 In addition, patches addressing these problems for the stable
 release can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 3.5:
 <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13990.patch">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13990.patch</A>
 <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13991.patch">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13991.patch</A>

 If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
 to the package vendor for availability information on updated
 packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

 All Squid-3.2 and older have not been tested but are expected to
 be vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-3.3 versions are vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-3.4 versions are vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-3.5.14 and older are vulnerable.

 All unpatched Squid-4.0.6 and older are vulnerable.

__________________________________________________________________

Workaround:

 There are no good workarounds known for these vulnerabilities.

 The following squid.conf settings can protect Squid-3.5 (only)
 against the publicly published attack. But unpatched Squid
 remain vulnerable to other known attacks:

   acl Vary rep_header Vary .
   store_miss deny Vary

Or,

 The following squid.conf settings can protect against the
 publicly published attack. But unpatched Squid remain vulnerable
 to other known attacks:

   cache deny all
