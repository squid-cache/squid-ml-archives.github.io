 Hi Robert,

Updates to cached content only happen for the specific objects asked
for, and in as efficient a manner as HTTP/1.1 permits. Unused objects or
once-off requests just age out and disappear with zero bandwidth costs
once they are no longer used.

Squid only uses bandwidth if it is explicitly asked to by a client. So
if nobody is using HTTP, there will not be anything happening. (There
are two exceptions here - if you have a cache_peer configured, there may
be netdb and cache-digest exchanges periodically between the proxies).

If you are seeing HTTP usage during off-hours then it is the machinery
of your network itself doing the requests. For this type of traffic you
could setup a &quot;time&quot; type ACL in the miss_access directive to deny
Internet usage during certain hours. This also leaves you with
access.log entries to investigate what is going on in those off-hours.

 acl offline time MTWHFSU 02:00-08:00
 miss_access deny offline
 miss_access allow all


Amos
