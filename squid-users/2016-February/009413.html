There is no obvious right answer.  I usually find immediate and visible
failure to be the best option in the long run.  But it is a judgement
call really.

&gt;<i> Q0: Do you think an admin should be able to control the choice among the
</I>&gt;<i> three options detailed above?
</I>
Not really, no.  But if you think it is not an undue burden for
developers, why not?

&gt;<i> Q1: Which option is the best default?
</I>
Option 1 - bail out.

&gt;<i> Q2: Would you prefer to see fewer assertions in exchange for more memory
</I>&gt;<i> leaks and an increased probability of malformed/corrupted/misleading
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP messages?
</I>
Nope.  I'd be worried that it would result in more fragile and harder to
debug systems.  I shouldn't have to babysit my servers.

While there are all kinds of people with various knowledge levels
administring proxy servers, second guessing the sysadmin is a dangerous
action.  I generally assume a professional sysadmin who knows what he is
doing - even though perhaps they are a dying breed.
