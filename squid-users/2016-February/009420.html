Thanks a lot for sharing your preferences!

Perhaps the context of those questions was somehow missed/lost in the
noise I have created around them. Sorry. Let me rephrase the last
question to illustrate why &quot;I shouldn't have to babysit my servers&quot;,
while obviously true, implies the opposite of what you seem to be
suggesting:

Q2: Your Squid is asserting every 5 minutes. There is no [working] Squid
version you can switch to. Your network topology does not allow you to
bypass Squid. Until the bug is fixed, would you prefer to see fewer
assertions in exchange for more memory leaks and an increased
probability of malformed/corrupted/misleading HTTP messages?


Thank you,

Alex.
