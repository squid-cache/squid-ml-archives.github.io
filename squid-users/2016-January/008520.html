Please:

1. Describe your network setup - specifically:
 - what is the client-facing IP address of your Squid server?
 - what network range are the clients in?

2. Post your squid.conf without comments or blank lines.

Partial information will almost certainly result in partial assistance from 
the list (not deliberately, just because we don't know enough to help as mich 
as we might).


Thanks,


Antony.
