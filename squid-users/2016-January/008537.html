Yes, but it's nowhere near as good as doing it with IP tools on the underlying 
O/S.

</I>
So, tell us where it is running, then...

&gt;<i> I've been thinking to create a multiple ports with squid and limit the

</I>
No idea, without knowing where you're starting from.

&gt;<i> Or is there a better way?
</I>
Almost certainly.

Explain, in as much detail as you can:

 - what your networking setup is
 - which version of Squid you are using
 - which Operating System (and version) you are running it under
 - what you want to achieve by &quot;shaping&quot;

The more information you give us, the more we might be able to help you.


Regards,


Antony.
