Certainly no problem for Squid, and I guess you could assign that number of 
separate listening ports for use one per user, but I'll let someone who knows 
more about Squid's internals for such an unusual setup comment on that if 
needed.

&gt;<i> &gt; - are you trying to limit the *inbound* bandwidth to Squid per user, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the *outbound* bandwidth from Squid to each user?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i want to limit the bandwidth. lets say user has 50mbit but i want him only

</I>
So, that's the outbound bandwidth from Squid to the user, then?  You don't 
mind if Squid fetches the requested content faster than that if it can, and 
then feeds it to the user no faster than 10Mbps?

Is this limit true for all users - ie: is there a single bandwidth limit you 
want to apply to all users, or are you trying to set different limits for 
different users?

&gt;<i> &gt; - what's the primary reason for wanting to restrict the bandwidth per
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> server has not unlimited speed. better control of the server bandwidth.
</I>
What total bandwidth are you dealing with?
What's the server load when it runs into problems?
How many concurrent user sessions do you have when the problems occur?
What are the effects of the problems you're having?

Is there any reason you can't use authentication to identify different users?

What stops users &quot;investigating&quot; the system, and finding out they can get extra 
bandwidth by using ports which haven't been assigned to them?



Regards,


Antony.
