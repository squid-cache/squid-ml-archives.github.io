&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How many users do you have?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i wanted to put about 200-500 users on a server. is that possible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly no problem for Squid, and I guess you could assign that number of 
</I>&gt;<i> separate listening ports for use one per user, but I'll let someone who knows 
</I>&gt;<i> more about Squid's internals for such an unusual setup comment on that if 
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>
ok.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - are you trying to limit the *inbound* bandwidth to Squid per user, or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the *outbound* bandwidth from Squid to each user?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i want to limit the bandwidth. lets say user has 50mbit but i want him only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use 10mbit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's the outbound bandwidth from Squid to the user, then?  You don't 
</I>&gt;<i> mind if Squid fetches the requested content faster than that if it can, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then feeds it to the user no faster than 10Mbps?
</I>
yep. that can work this way.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this limit true for all users - ie: is there a single bandwidth limit you 
</I>&gt;<i> want to apply to all users, or are you trying to set different limits for 
</I>&gt;<i> different users?
</I>
only one limit for every user.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - what's the primary reason for wanting to restrict the bandwidth per
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> user?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server has not unlimited speed. better control of the server bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What total bandwidth are you dealing with?
</I>1gbit/s (but i guess its a bit less than that. maybe it will peak at 500mbit)
&gt;<i> What's the server load when it runs into problems?
</I>have not tested it so far with so many users.
&gt;<i> How many concurrent user sessions do you have when the problems occur?
</I>no problems right. cause not enough load.
&gt;<i> What are the effects of the problems you're having?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason you can't use authentication to identify different users?
</I>it does not work with nated ips. it autheticates with ip adress anyway. so it will limit the ip to 10mbit but behind that ip there are maybe 10 or more ppl.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What stops users &quot;investigating&quot; the system, and finding out they can get extra 
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth by using ports which haven't been assigned to them?
</I>
thats the second problem to deal with. there is some kind of a captive portal with login but it opens the port after user autheticates so actually someone else can use that port. so if you have an idea. i would be really thankful :)

Kind regards,

Chris
