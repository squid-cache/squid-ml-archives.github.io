</I>Great to hear. I've got some 600,000+ domain lists (ie dstdomain) and
60,000+ url lists (ie url_regex) acls, and there are a couple of
&quot;gotchas&quot; I've picked up during testing

1. at startup squid reports &quot;WARNING: there are more than 100 regular
expressions. Consider using less REs&quot;. Is that now legacy and ignorable?
(should that be removed?). Obviously I have over 60,000 REs
2. making any change to squid and restarting/reconfiguring it now means
I'm seeing a 12sec outage as squid reads those acls off SSD
drives/parses them/etc. With squidguard that outage is hidden because
squidguard uses indexed files instead of the raw files and that
parsing/etc can be done offline. That behavioral change is pretty
dramatic: making a minor, unrelated change to squid now involves a
10+sec outage (instead of &lt;1sec). I'd say &quot;outsourcing&quot; this kind of
function to another process (such as url_rewriter or ICAP) still has
it's advantages ;-)
