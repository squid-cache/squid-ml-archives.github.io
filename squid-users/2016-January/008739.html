Please start by reading this

&gt;<i> and searching about them explains that i

Welcome to HTTP/1.1. Those are all HTTP/1.1 revalidation requests
updating the cached content before delivery to the client. While saving
bandwidth in ways that HIT and MISS cannot.

Squid is a cache, not an archive. It self-updates the cache content as
needed.

 - the UNMODIFIED are when the copy the Squid already has cached is not
changed. No payload object is fetched from the server.

 - the MODIFIED are where both the Squid cached object is outdated. A
replacment object is delivered by the server.

- the 304 are when the client copy has not changed. So no payload is
delivered from Squid to client.

- the 200 are when the client copy is outdated. A replacment object is
delivered by Squid.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also noticed TCP_REFRESH_UNMODIFIED/200 happens for google chrome debian

Blindly turning off performance and bandwidth saving mechanisms simply
because you cant understand the log is not a great idea.

FYI: almost all tutorials you will find online are from people working
with old HTTP/1.0 Squid versions or only understanding HTTP/1.0
behaviour (like you and your HIT/MISS focus).


* reload-into-ims is fine, that changes the forced-MISS Chrome is trying
to make happen into these nicer refresh/revalidation that save some
bandwidth but still deliver the full-sized 200 status reply Chrome demands.

* ignore-reload cancels the effect of the above (if it works).

* override-expire is also fine. It only forces content to stay in cache
longer than Expires/max-age header says it should. Old content cached by
this will lead to MISS/200 becoming MODIFIED/200 in your logs - if you
are lucky it might become UNMODIFIED.

The other options do more harm than good.

You heard about how Steam recently had a big issue about showing gamers
each others account details? that was a cache somewhere in their system
doing its equivalent of &quot;ignore-no-store ignore-private
ignore-must-revalidate&quot;.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can any one help me with this issue? is this normal? Or there is an issue
</I>&gt;<i> in my squid config?  I have attached my squid config and some sample log
</I>&gt;<i> which confuses me.
</I>
So far as I can tell from your description what is happening is both
normal and Good. So dont panic.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My squid version is : 3.3.8 for detail options and squid config file i have
</I>&gt;<i> pasted the content of both at, ( Operating system is Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;trusty&quot; )

</I>
It is fine to just add &quot;refresh-into-ims&quot; to the end of the
&quot;refresh_pattern .&quot; line. Then you can remove all those special
PackagesSources/Release/Translations patterns.

The udeb$ pattern is not doing anything because the deb$ pattern already
matches all those URLs. So you can remove the &quot;refresh_pattern udeb$&quot; line.

I suspect the &quot;dl.google.com/.*\.(deb)&quot; line is not doing anything for
the same reason. But it does not require the end of URL to be &quot;deb&quot;, so
may be randomly matching URLs with query-strings.


I'm not sure what will change if you remove the deb$ pattern as well. I
found repository servers vary by mirror software what HTTP headers they
produce - which affects whether Squid default patterns cache them nicely
or MISS a lot.
 Up to you, the rule as-is should be harmless at worst.

</I>
If you look closely all the UNMODIFIED/304 are very tiny 0.33 KB
transfers. Even though they are equivalent to a full HIT. Those Packages
files can be MB in size.
