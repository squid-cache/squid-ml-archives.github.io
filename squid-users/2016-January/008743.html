Firstly, please don't hijack someone elses thread, that makes things
confusing.  Post a new message of your own so people can follow the
thread.  Secondly, you need to provide answers to all the questions that
L.P.H. van Belle asked, this will give people a good picture of what
your set up is like and where the problem may be.
