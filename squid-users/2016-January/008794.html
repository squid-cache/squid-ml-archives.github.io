<PRE>Again thanks for the explanation.

I understand the step1/2/3 for sslbump and Squid extracts the domain 
name at various steps(SNI, client hello, server hello,etc) and there is 
no guarantee which step will get what I want.

Assuming the ssl is fully bumped(not spliced), that means their http 
request-line(the full URL) and http header(e.g. referer) are now 
available in clear text inside Squid, my question is that, can Squid now 
&quot;extract&quot; them and let me use them via directives, just like I use 
url_regex/urlpath_regex/referer_regex when http mode is used.

I tested external_acl_type and the URI/PATH were empty for _bumped_ ssl 
traffic too.

Basically I'm trying to see how to get the http-header info from a 
bumped ssl connection and use them directly inside squid.conf(including 
external acl), otherwise icap/ecap is unavoidable for bumped ssl http 
header analysis.

Thanks,
xxiao

</I>&gt;<i> One way to improve your understanding of reality is to stop thinking

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 2. CONNECT transaction(s) that are HTTP transactions with limited info.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. SSL connection establishment (and bumping).
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Bumped HTTPS transaction(s) treated as regular HTTP transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most HTTP-focused ACLs like url_regex are meant for regular HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> transactions (stage #4). They are of limited use for CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> transactions (stage #2) and usually do not work during stages #1 and #3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ICAP/eCAP adaptation may be applied during stage #2 (with limited
</I>&gt;<i> information) and stage #4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The statement &quot;referer_regex does not work for https/sslbump&quot; is neither
</I>&gt;<i> true nor false. Thus, you are getting conflicting responses and are
</I>&gt;<i> likely to create poorly working configurations until you realize that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;referer_regex&quot; works well at stage #4 but may also be applied at stage
</I>&gt;<i> #2 where it does not work well (not enough information in the CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> requests) or at stages #1 and #3 where it should not be used at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ACL is just a &quot;named condition&quot; or a &quot;function&quot;. You can type an ACL
</I>&gt;<i> name X in any squid.conf directives that use ACLs. That does not mean
</I>&gt;<i> that ACL X works with all directives at all times. Someday, Squid or
</I>&gt;<i> some squid.conf lint tool would warn about ACLs used in wrong places.
</I>&gt;<i> For now, you have to understand what stage-dependent information the
</I>&gt;<i> directive has access to and avoid ACLs that require information
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable to the directive at the current processing stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck,
