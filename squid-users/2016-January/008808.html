If you're asking whether Squid will cache and/or proxy replies from webservers 
where it hasn't seen the requests, then no.

If you're asking whether Squid cares about whether its upstream connection to 
the webserver/s, and the downstream replies from the webserver/s go along 
different routes, then no.

So, both request and reply packets have to pass through Squid.&#160; How those 
packets get routed between client and Squid, and between Squid and server, and 
then back again, is immaterial (provided any NAT along the way is correctly 
reversed on replies, but if you weren't doing that, then replies would never 
get back to the clients anyway).

'weekending'.&#160; It put a premium on people who could write things that lasted 
thirty seconds, and Douglas was incapable of writing a single sentence that 
lasted less than thirty seconds.
