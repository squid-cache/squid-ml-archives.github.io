By enabling OpenSSL support you are already changing the dependencies.
This is why using the packaging system to build the altered squid
package is recommended in the first place. It will take care of the
dependency linkages when done that way, as well as the package version
upgrades later.

No it is not possible. All contributors to Squid need to give their
permission for the change. Many contributors to Squid are not able to be
contacted any longer. Therefore the liense is fixed as GPL until such
time as we can replace the code with unknown authors.


Perhapse you would like to support my work adding GnuTLS support
instead? its not going to happen quickly, but every bit helps.
