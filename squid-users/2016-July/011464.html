</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since Squid tries to mimic the behavior of the server and of the client,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it deserves a patch where instead of doing a DNS lookup and then doing a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> connect (based on the result of the DNS lookup?),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Squid simply connects to the IP address that the client tries to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and does the TLS handshake with the SNI (that does not make sense).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This way it mimics the client a bit better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe that is what Squid does already but please correct me if I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Steve said that Squid rejects the connection because of a failed DNS
</I>&gt;<i> lookup.
</I>&gt;<i> So what is Squid doing?  Is it doing  the following ?
</I>&gt;<i> - connect to the original IP
</I>&gt;<i> - use the presented SNI to the server
</I>&gt;<i> - do a DNS lookup and reject
</I>
No it is doing Host: header verification on the faked CONNECT request
which uses the SNI in the Host: header value. This is not strictly
required for CONNECT messages, but does potentially prevent Squid using
other IPs than the original one the client was contacting.
If the SNI is a valid domain name (ie resolves in DNS). Then Squid
should continue on past the check.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When forming a fake CONNECT request, Squid uses SNI information because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is what ACLs and adaptation services usually want to see. However,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope that intercepting Squid always connects to the intended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destination of the intercepted connection instead of trusting its own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fake CONNECT request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is interesting to know if an ICAP server or URL rewriter is called
</I>&gt;<i> and with which parameters when the ios app breaks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whether Squid should generate a fake CONNECT with a wildcard host name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is an interesting question:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. A fake CONNECT targeting an wildcard name may break ACL-driven rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and adaptation services (at least).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. A fake CONNECT targeting an IP address instead of a wildcard name may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not give some ACL-driven rules and adaptation services enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information to make the right decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. A premature rejection of a connection with wildcard SNI does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow the admin to make the bump/splice/terminate decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> #2 is probably the lesser of the three evils, but I wonder whether Squid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should also include the invalid host name as an X-SNI or similar HTTP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header in that CONNECT request, to give advanced ACLs and adaptation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services a better chance to work around known benign issues where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> admin knows the wildcard is not malicious (and to kill wildcard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions the admin knows to be malicious!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I use url_rewrite_extras with &quot;... sni=\&quot;%ssl::&gt;sni\&quot; ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> so the URL redirector receives both the original IP address and
</I>&gt;<i> the peeked SNI value to make its decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that an ICAP service needs X-SNI or perhaps X-Squid-SNI to
</I>&gt;<i> also get both the IP address and the SNI value.
</I>
That is a problem for the service. Squid can already send anything in:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/adaptation_meta/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/adaptation_meta/</A>&gt;.

Maybe you have mistaken it for the inability of most ICAP services to
send things back to Squid in the same way.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A similar question can be asked about SNI names containing unusual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characters. At some point, it would be too dangerous to include SNI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information in the fake CONNECT request because it will interfere with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTTP rules, but it is not clear where that point is exactly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To support the weirdest apps Squid might have to simply copy all
</I>&gt;<i> unusual characters to present the same parameter values to the server.
</I>
It is being mapped into the HTTP equivalent value. Which are Host:
header and authority-URI. Only valid FQDN names can make it through the
mapping.

&gt;<i> But we do not want to break things... so which characters are
</I>&gt;<i> so unusual that Squid does not want to accept them?
</I>
In Steve's case the asterisk at the start of the domain name. The name
labels must each start with an alphabet character a-z or A-Z.  That is a
fixed requirement. The other characters that follow are where things get
fuzzy depending on what RFCs you follow.
