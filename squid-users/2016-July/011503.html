Yes, it's impossible.

The client needs to see a server certificate signed by a trusted CA.

If Squid is going to intercept (which I infer from your question) HTTPS 
connections, it has to present a certificate to the client which it has created 
on-the-fly for the destination server and which is acceptable to the client.

To cerate such certificates on-the-fly, Squid needs to have a CA certificate and 
a private signing key, to create new certificates trusted by any client which 
trust that CA.

If it were able to do that using any of the CA certificates already installed 
and trusted by standard clients, then Squid would be able to fake a certificate 
for (almost) any site on the Internet, thus destroying the HTTPS trust model.

That ain't gonna happen.

Therefore the only way to do HTTPS interception is to create a local CA and 
install that CA's certificate on all clients which need to use that Squid.

The whole point is that HTTPS interception is a MITM &quot;attack&quot; (I use the term 
slightly loosely), and therefore no browser is going to let you get away with 
it lightly.

Hope that helps,


Antony.
