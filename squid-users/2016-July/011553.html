For the record, yoru image shows an Ubuntu control panel which has found
a machine somewhere on the network and decided to name it &quot;Network
Proxy&quot;. No other details about it are shown.

The image has as much meaning as if it said &quot;Some Server&quot; instead of
&quot;Network Proxy&quot;.

FYI: &quot;Network proxy&quot; is a *type* of thing. If there is actually a
machine called that it might be a proxy, or it might be a malicious host
trying to grab traffic on your network, or a user jokingly naming their
host &quot;Network Proxy&quot;.

 So be careful. Be sure that machine is what you want your traffic to go
through.


&gt;<i> I installed proxy squid on it. I want to connect squid proxy to to that
</I>&gt;<i> network, not like on browser you normal see on any tutorial. How to do it?
</I>&gt;<i> please tell me step by step.

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;normal tutorial&quot;. Normal tutorials for
Squid are about how to setup various clients to use Squid. Not how to
use Squid through a peer proxy.

And there you ave some keywords to lookup, &quot;peer&quot; being the main one.

The cache_peer directive
(&lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer/</A>&gt;) is used to tell
Squid about any server that it should direct traffic through. You will
need the name or IP addres of the server, and which port it receives
proxy traffic through.

If that server is the only way your Squid can access the network, then
you may want to also configure these as well as the cache_peer:
 cache_peer_access allow all
 never_direct deny all
 nonhierarchical_direct off

If it only receives traffic via interception of port 80 then there is
nothing to be done in Squid.
