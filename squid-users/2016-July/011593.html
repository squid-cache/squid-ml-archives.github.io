Please tell us what you are trying to use it for - what do you want to get 
squid to do for you?

&gt;<i> I follow step by step ( some tutorial blog )
</I>
Please tell us which tutorial you are following.  Some are good, some are not 
so good.  Some are good for beginners, some are for more experienced users.

&gt;<i> I have to edit file squid.conf for use it. I don't know how to edit it.
</I>
Do you mean that you do not know how to edit a configuration file, or do you 
mean that you do not know what changes you need to make to this file?

If you do not know how to use an editor, follow one of the links provided in 
Yuri's recent answer to you.

If you do know how to use an editor, but you do not know what changes you need 
to make to the file, then either:

 - read some of the excellent documentation from (for example) 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples</A>

 - tell us here what you want Squid to do, and we can help you make it do it.

But, the simple fact is that if you don't tell us what you're trying to 
achieve, how can we tell you how to do that?

&gt;<i> please somebody tell me step step how to do it? i ask here because i need
</I>&gt;<i> complete full answer.
</I>
In that case we need a complete full question - you tell us what you are 
trying to get Squid to do f royu, and tell us what your network setup is, and 
then we might be able to help you.  So far you have ignored all questions 
asking you to tell us what you're trying to do.  Do you expect us to guess?

As Amos has pointed out to you previously, this is *not* the standard 
squid.conf configuration file.  It is (as it says at the top) &quot;the documentation 
for the Squid configuration file&quot;.

I do not believe that this file got installed as /etc/squid/squid.conf by 
installing the squid package under Ubunut (which I believe you are using).


Regards,


Antony.
