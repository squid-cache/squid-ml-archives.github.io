<PRE>Thanks Amos,

The concept is simple and easy to implement but it is not maintained anymore.
The url <A HREF="http://gremlin.ru/soft/drbl/en/zones.html">http://gremlin.ru/soft/drbl/en/zones.html</A> is broken :\

I have also seen: RiskIQ -&gt; <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiskIQ">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiskIQ</A>
And a dnsmasq blacklist: <A HREF="https://github.com/britannic/blacklist">https://github.com/britannic/blacklist</A>
And a reverse proxy idea: <A HREF="https://github.com/marinhero/goxy">https://github.com/marinhero/goxy</A>

In any case it's not like DHT and similar ideas.
The drbl has a very solid concept but lacks couple concepts compared to what I was thinking about.

Currently I have a client for public rbls such as Symantec and OpenDNS.
And this is nice example code that handles dns blacklist queries in golang: <A HREF="https://github.com/jersten/ipchk">https://github.com/jersten/ipchk</A>
(for me to remember later)

I will try to calculate couple things and then I will move on.

I suggest you look into how DRBL works,
&lt;<A HREF="http://gremlin.ru/soft/drbl/en/faq.html">http://gremlin.ru/soft/drbl/en/faq.html</A>&gt;. The distributed blacklist
design was created by the anti-spam community as both a protection for
maintainers against legal threats to list administrators, and to provide
resistance against individual nodes disappearing for any other reason.
 That system would allow immedate linkup with some existing Rpublic
blacklists like SURBL, which lists websites used by spammers for malware
or phish hosting.

All thats needed in Squid would be an ACL to do the lookups.
