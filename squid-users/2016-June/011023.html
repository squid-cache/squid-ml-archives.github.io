Please define &quot;issue&quot;, with as much detail as possible:

 - what exactly are you trying to do when a problem occurs?

 - have you previously been able to do this without the problem occurring?  If 
so, what has changed between then and now (different squid config, different 
squid version, different browser...)?

 - what is the actual problem (what error message is displayed, if there is 
one)?

 - what appears in your access.log when the problem occurs?

 - any other information you think might be relevant to us in working out 
what's happening on your network?

&gt;<i> I have squid 3.1.10 on RHEL.6.0
</I>
For HTTPS traffic in particular you are strongly advised to upgrade.


Regards,

Antony.
