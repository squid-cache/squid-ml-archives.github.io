<PRE>Hello all,

Hello all,

I have been running squid 2.7.X alongside squidguard 1.4 on a FreeBSD
8.x box for years. Started out some 10 years ago, with a much older
squid/squidguard/FreeBSD combination.

Having to upgrade to FreeBSD 10.3, I examined my option regarding
squid. 3.5.19 was available which I assumed would behave the same as
2.7, regarding compatibility. Squidguard 1.4 was also installed.

- Squid was configured to behave along the lines of what I had on 2.7.
- For squidguard I used the exact same blocklists and configurations.
Note that I do not employ an URL rewriting in squidguard, only
redirection.
- no SSL-bump or other SSL interception takes place
- the squidguard-related lines on squid are the following:

url_rewrite_program /usr/local/bin/squidGuard
url_rewrite_children 8 startup=4 idle=4 concurrency=0
url_rewrite_access allow all

- In squidGuard.conf, the typical redirect section is like:

 default {
                pass local-ok !block1 !block2 !blockN all
                redirect
301:<A HREF="http://localsite/block.htm?clientaddr=%a+clientname=%n+clientident=%i+srcclass=%s+targetclass=%t+url=%u">http://localsite/block.htm?clientaddr=%a+clientname=%n+clientident=%i+srcclass=%s+targetclass=%t+url=%u</A>
        }

I am now experiencing problems that I did not have. Specifically,
access to certain but *not* all HTTPS sites seems to timeout.
Furthermore, I see entries similar to the following in cache.log:

Searching around, the closest I have come to an answer is the
following: <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-users/201211/0165.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-users/201211/0165.html</A>
I am not sure though whether I am plagued by the same issue,
considering that the thread refers to a squid version dated 4 years
ago. And I definitely do not understand what the is meant by the
poster's proposal:

&quot;If you can't alter the re-writer to perform redirection you can work
around that by using:

  acl foo ... some test to match the re-written URL ...
  deny_info 302:%s foo
  adapted_http_access deny foo &quot;

Can someone help resolve this? Is the 2.7 series supported at all? As
is if everything fails, I'll have to go back to it if there's some
support.

BR,


Michael.-
