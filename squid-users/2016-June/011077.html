squidGuard is slow since each process opens the database and
has a private cache of 15% of the database.
So if a squidGuard process does a URL lookup it does a lookup in the
database cache and may read from disk (or the OS file system cache).

ufdbGuard does it differently: the url_rewriter process is a lightweight
process that forwards a URL lookup to a multithreaded daemon that holds
a single copy of the URL database in memory.  The database format is
also optimised for in-memory lookups.
ufdbGuard does 50,000 URL lookups/second on an
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 v2 with 4 cores/8 threads.
