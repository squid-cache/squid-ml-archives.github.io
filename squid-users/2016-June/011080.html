They do not. The 'S' makes them different. Very different.

Squid currently has to be built with OpenSSL support in order to perform
the TLS protocol actions needed by <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs and also HTTPS
protocol. Since OpenSSL software license is not compatible with GPL
license used by Squid some popular vendors are not providing HTTPS
enabled binaries on legal grounds (most notably Debian, Ubuntu and their
derivatives).

Any build of Squid though is capable of relaying HTTP CONNECT tunnels
containing HTTPS. But that requires the client software to do the tunnel
wrapping, and be using the proxy explicitly.
