I recommend starting with the proposal described in my item #2. A proof
of concept is usually needed when there is doubt that the concept can
work in principle. There is no such doubt here IMO.

</I>
It is possible to map virtually anything to HTTP messages and, hence, to
eCAP/ICAP. For example, Squid maps FTP transactions to HTTP messages! A
better mapping would preserve more information, make it easier to access
that information by services that understand the protocol being mapped,
have lower overhead, etc. However, it is clearly &quot;possible&quot; to come up
with some mapping.


&gt;<i> Actually it may or may not be related but I am
</I>&gt;<i> curious how Squid handles Comet(Ajax/HTTP Server Push) during ICAP
</I>&gt;<i> processing. 
</I>
Squid proxies regular HTTP/1 and FTP. That excludes pure server push
until we add HTTP/2 support.


&gt;<i> About server first protocols, current ICAP services expecting
</I>&gt;<i> encapsulated valid HTTP responses for requests will break of course.
</I>
I do not think so. A proper mapping could present that spontaneous
from-server message as an HTTP response to a trivial fake request
(enough to identify the protocol and the server address).

Needless to say, the WebSockets:HTTP mapping (and overall Squid
functionality) can be improved if Squid understands WebSockets (as Amos
has noted in his response), but I do not think such understanding is
_required_ to accommodate many useful adaptation use cases.


&gt;<i> Maybe a mechanism like Allow 204 negotiation can be implemented between
</I>&gt;<i> adaptation service and proxy. If adaptation service does not support
</I>&gt;<i> server first pushes it can be bypassed. 
</I>
It is always possible to extend ICAP and eCAP, but, with all other
factors being equal, extending should be a last-resort solution because
most adaptation services will not support the extension and many of
those services could work fine without that extension.


HTH,

Alex.
