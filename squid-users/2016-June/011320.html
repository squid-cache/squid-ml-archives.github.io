It sounds like a timeout or such has happened inside Squid. We'd need to
see your squid.conf to see if that was it.

What version are you using? there have been a few bugs found that can
cause unrelated connections to be closed early like this.

Screen dump of packet capture does not usually help. We usually only ask
for packet captures when one of the dev needs to personally analyse the
full traffic behaviour.

A cache.log trace at debug level 11,2 shows all the HTTP messages going
through in an easier format to read. There might be hints in there, but
if it is a timeout like I suspect probably not.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> you can see the client connection got closed)
</I>
So Squid is closing both connections from the middle. That is pointing
strongly at a timeout, bug, or error in the data transfer.
