The options *on http_port* are supposed to act like that, yes.

I think you have just mistaken the distinction between the three types
of connection Squid has to juggle.


http(s)_port is for links between client and Squid. Those parameters
used for verifying *client certificates*.

sslproxy_* set of directives are for direct Squid-&gt;server links. The
sslproxy_cafile and/or sslproxy_capath load the extra special CA you
want to add to the system default ones.

cache_peer is for static links to a known server/peer. It has its own
cafile= and capath= options for CA to verify that specific server.
Ideally the system CAs would not be used here.


If I'm understanding your needs correctly then you want to be
configuring sslproxy_cafile and/or sslproxy_capath.
