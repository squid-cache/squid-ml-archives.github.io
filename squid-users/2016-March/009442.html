<PRE>Hey Eray,

Indeed all of these are good and sysadmins should be able to handle them 
but.. in specific cases it's not easy.
The cases I know about are:
- SAT links (slow or costly)
- Sensitive acl\security systems
- Very low quality distance wireless links

In the case of ACLs system bypass or bridging might not be an option if 
the stakes are high(This is where I asked myself couple times why IT 
managers doesn't like to pay for industrial guarantees).

I am happy with squid for a very long time and I couldn't understand why 
a friend of mine wasn't happy about it. Only when I was with him and he 
showed me what happens when he tries to install and run squid I 
understood the Blocking issue. Eventually for him a special customized 
proxy was the answer.

Thanks,
Eliezer
