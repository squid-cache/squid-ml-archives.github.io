Unfortunately, it is often a real one. In the real world, Squid is often
a single point of failure without good bypass options.

Learning from failures is hardly the worst case. The worst cases in the
real world include innocent admins losing their jobs, kids exposed to
content they cannot unsee, etc., etc. It should not be that way, but it
sometimes is.

</I>

These questions are exactly about &quot;designing your systems&quot; better! Squid
is a &quot;system&quot; itself, and if you think that there is always a way to
bypass Squid, then it should be easy for you to accept the same [false]
premise that there is always a way to bypass an assertion inside Squid.
Designing Squid to bypass internal failures is what options #2 and #3
are about. Same premise, same architectural principles, different zoom
level.


Cheers,

Alex.
