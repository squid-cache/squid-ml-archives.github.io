Yuri,

You are right but since some of us do have legal obligations to some 
laws and do not live in a desert on the moon or the sun like Google or 
other services, I do tend to mention this side since it's not obviates 
to everybody.

Also I do understand why netflix would want to preserve their profits 
and investment in any of their services. Eventually they like many 
others do not like their plate of food being taken while smelling or 
tasting the result of their cooking skills.
There is a saying about eating raw non cooked food which I fully 
understand and this is the same for this scenario. If it was cooked, you 
need to at-least say thank you and in many ways the only way to do so is 
by paying couple bucks.
The only case which I think that it will be allowed by the cook and the 
owner of the food to be taken is when it will not heart him or any of 
the related parties life\soul.
Eventually maybe not everybody sees it this way but the possibility of 
pinning a certificate is reserved for anyone that needs to have a basic 
safety-net for his basic needs. The way I see it, the only case that I 
will live in a country that prohibit the use of certificate pinning is 
when this country will provide me the basic safety-net for a way to earn 
my food(and couple other basic needs..).

If for example the &quot;lets encrypt&quot; idea\program was designed to give a 
safety-net for many organizations which are fighting to survive in this 
very wide Internet with so many predators within it, then I vote +1 for 
them but if the idea was meant to or will cripple the encryption world I 
would vote -10^1000000.

So it's not really a lawyer thing but rather a simple understanding of 
this very very beautiful and amazing world.

Eliezer
