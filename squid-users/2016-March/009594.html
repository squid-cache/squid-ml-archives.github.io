If Squid creates shared memory segments without you using SMP features,
it is a Squid bug. I recall fixing one such bug in Squid v4/trunk
recently. Perhaps it exists in v3.5 as well. I recommend filing a bug
report while specifying exactly which files are being created.

Squid bug. I recall fixing one such bug in Squid v4/trunk recently.
Perhaps it exists in v3.5 as well. I recommend filing a bug report while
specifying exactly which files are left behind.


FWIW, Squid v4 supports the &quot;-n&quot; command line option to assist with
running multiple instances on the same box (with or without using SMP
features). I do not remember whether v3.5 supports that as well but it
may. I do not remember whether &quot;-n&quot; support extends to shared memory
segment names but it should.

Alex.
