That one is easy. *everything* in HTTP is downloaded. It is only how you
view it that changes (in-browser vs. out-of-browser).

 &quot;http_access deny all&quot;

But perhapse there is a more detailed definition of &quot;files&quot; that was
intended.

Not stupid at all. There are some good reasons any of these might be
needed. The vagueness is the main problem.


&gt;<i> 1. Download files from the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That one is easy &gt;:-). *everything* in HTTP is downloaded. It is only
how you view it that changes (in-browser vs. out-of-browser).

So:
  &quot;http_access deny all&quot;

But perhapse there is a more detailed definition of &quot;files&quot; that was
intended. See the example for #3 below. Once you can narrow down *what
types* of files are relevant (audio, video, executables, archives, pdf,
text, flash, etc, etc ?) you can use reply content-type restriction to
control them arriving.
 NP: Squid will still fetch them from the server (we cant stop that at
least starting to arrive), but be blocked from delivering to the user.

Note that streaming (#3) is just a audio/video file being downloaded. It
happens to be being played at the same time. But it is still a download.


&gt;<i> 2. Use Web forums.
</I>
Likewise. Anything in www can be a forum. To do anything useful &quot;forums&quot;
needs to be defined in a technical way. As does &quot;use&quot;.

I expect this one will end up being a long list of domains just by itself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Use streaming audio/video.
</I>
This is somewhat easier than #1. Since &quot;audio/video&quot; is already a clear
technical definition.

&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/#Multimedia_and_Data_Stream_filtering">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/#Multimedia_and_Data_Stream_filtering</A>&gt;

Example is not complete by any means. But demonstrates how to do it for
the AV stuff you want to block.

You may also want to use:

 acl radio proto ICY
 http_reply_access deny radio


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am perfectly aware that an advanced Internet user will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> circumvent those prohibitions, but still, any recipes? I have looked
</I>&gt;<i> in <A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl</A> but found nothing
</I>&gt;<i> very useful.
</I>
Without technical definitions for &quot;files&quot;, &quot;forums&quot;, and &quot;use&quot; its all
just too vague.
