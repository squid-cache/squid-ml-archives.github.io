<PRE>Hi there

I'm wanting to use tls intercept to just log (well OK, and potentially
block) HTTPS sites based on hostnames (from SNI), but have had problems
even in peek-and-splice mode. So I'm willing to compromise and instead just
intercept that traffic, log it, block on IP addresses if need be, and don't
use ssl-bump beyond that.

So far the following seems to work perfectly, can someone confirm this is
&quot;supported&quot; - ie that I'm not relying on some bug that might get fixed
later? ;-)

sslcrtd_program /usr/lib64/squid/ssl_crtd -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 256MB
sslcrtd_children 32 startup=15 idle=5
acl SSL_https port 443
ssl_bump splice SSL_https
acl BlacklistedHTTPSsites dstdomain
&quot;/etc/squid/acl-BlacklistedHTTPSsites.txt&quot;
http_access deny BlacklistedHTTPSsites

The &quot;bug&quot; comment comes down to how acl seems to work. I half-expected the
above not to work - but it does. It would appear squid will treat an
intercept's dst IP as the &quot;dns name&quot; as that's all it's got - so
&quot;dstdomain&quot; works fine for both CONNECT and intercept IFF the acl contains
IP addresses

I was hoping I wouldn't need ssl-bump at all, but you need squid to be
running a https_port, and for it to support &quot;intercept&quot;, and to do that
squid insists on &quot;ssl-bump&quot; too - although that seems likely was a
programmer assumption that didn't include people like me doing mad things
like this? :-). I'd also guess I don't need 32 children/etc  - 1 would
suffice as it's never used?

So the end result is that all CONNECT and/or intercept SSL/TLS traffic is
supported via the proxy, with all TLS security decisions residing on the
client. I get my logs, and if I want to block some known bad IP address, I
can: CONNECT causes a 403 HTTP error page and intercept basically ditches
the tcp/443 connection - which is as good as it gets without getting into
the wonderful world of real &quot;bump&quot;
