No. Because the below. And because Squid is tightly focussed on the
proxying task which is plenty complex enough already.

&gt;<i> Is there a way to do this now?
</I>
ICAP and eCAP interfaces are provided by Squid-3 and later for all
adaptation needs that go beyond simple HTTP header adjustment.

If that Suricata software supports ICAP(S) it can be plugged straight
into a Squid already to receive the SSL-Bump decoded traffic.

Otherwise you might need to write up a translator. In that case eCAP is
probably the simplest way to go. You just need to check which eCAP
library version(s) the Squid to be used supports/requires.
