Yes the way you have been describing the &quot;inline setup&quot; that you want it
reads exactly as if you were describing how ICAP works.

By &quot;plugging into Squid&quot; with ICAP I mean setting some squid.conf
directives to tell Squid were to send the traffic through its ICAP
interface (and what to send that way).


&gt;<i> In other words could the software forward the traffic back

</I>&gt;<i> would the traffic be encrypted at that point?
</I>
The SSL-Bump feature of Squid decrypts TLS on arrival, and re-encrypts
when sending to the upstream HTTP server. What can be decrypted is
unencrypted when sent to ICAP and/or eCAP.

If the TLS/SSL cannot be &quot;Bumped&quot; by Squid (or you choose to configure
Squid not to for any reason). Then that traffic is not sent through the
ICAP/eCAP services.
