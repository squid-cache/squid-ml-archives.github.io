<PRE>I was wondering to myself, If I can generate certificates and bump the
connection, I can use a 302\308 to redirect all traffic from https to a
http(intercepatble) connection.

Then on the http interceptor rewrite the request into https.

I have a working setup which uses a redirection &quot;attack&quot; to authenticate
users over http+https.

Now the issue is that if all browsers will deny a redirection from https to
http(a downgrading attack) then the http world would look a bit weird.


I was thinking about such a downgrade attack on couple sites but I am unsure
how good it will be.

I have seen couple years ago that some ISPs used a redirection attack when
youtube used plain http, this was in order to allow a &quot;pre-fetch&quot; of a tiny
GET request.

Now since many others up-graded their security it's another story.

 

And as an addition I have seen that Microsoft use and &quot;FTP&quot; like transfer
protocol in their software.

They have a &quot;secured&quot; control channel which has certificates pinning or
something else as a safe guard,
and in more then one case they use another channel to fetch the request over
plain HTTP( when a proxy is defined).

 

Would it be reasonable to write and publish such a tool? Or is it a security
risk to publish such a tool to the public?
