Yes.

It would be helpful if you could give us a clearer error report.

Useful information for someone to be able to help you:

 - what version of Squid are you running?
 - what platform (O/S, distro, 32/64 bit) are you running it on?
 - what version of Windows are you running AD on?
 - what version of AD are you using?
 - what problems do your users experience when they try to authenticate?

&gt;<i> and no there is no one who reponds to problems, it's a shame.
</I>
I see you've posted several messages to this list between November 2015 and 
April 1st this year, and you've had many replies to those messages (many from 
Amos Jeffries, the primary current developer of Squid), so I think your 
complaint that &quot;no-one responds to problems&quot; is quite unreasonable.

&gt;<i> there is commercial support a squid?
</I>
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/services.html">http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/services.html</A>

By all means continue to ask here on this list - provided you give sufficient 
information, there may well be someone who can provide sufficient help.

Alternatively, as you can see, there are several opportunities for commercial 
support contracts.


Good luck,


Regards,


Antony.
