<PRE>I'd seen this licensing issue mentioned briefly before, but now I 
actually understand what's going on. Thanks for explaining it in detail.

Good to know there's 2 paths moving along to solve the distro problem. I 
feel more confident in moving forward with my little project now that I 
know it's only going to be a temporary annoyance to recompile.

Thanks everyone who answered.
