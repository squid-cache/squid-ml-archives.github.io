The CONNECT message *is* clear-text HTTP. So already it is doing what
you asked. But I think what you want is not want you are asking for.

Squid supports receiving requests for <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs from clients on
regular TCP connections and will perform the HTTPS part for them.

Squid also supports clients using TLS to connect to the proxy, then to
pass it requests for <A HREF="https://">https://</A> URLs. There is a sad lack of clients that
support doing that though.


If the client is performing TLS to the origin server, then no. You
cannot reply with plain-text HTTP to them. Your only choice in that case
is the SSL-Bump feature.
