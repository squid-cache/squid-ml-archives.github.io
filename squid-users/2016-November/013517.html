<PRE>They have 30 days of trial&#8230;.

Try and see how it works for you.

I believe that it might work for many of the listed sites.

If it is being maintained weekly then it would work for other sites also.

I'm not about it. 

There is a difference between help and passengers. Who want to get a turnkey solution without doing anything.

Personally, I quite simply as help to specify the direction, or to show that anything is possible in principle. The rest I do myself. If I do not - then I buy it.

At the beginning of the thread I made it - that direction. I think that should be enough, is not it?

Store-ID is not quite cached. This deduplication and this is just what
you need for dynamic content, which is the majority of the video. Do not
forget about the volume of the video itself.

As for the cache, you should look at what video has captions under
HTTPS. Modern vanilla SQUID can not in most cases its cache that
Store-ID with that without it. Because of video HTTP headers and pragmas.

In any case, the complete solution is too complex for the majority of
ordinary users Squid and too costly in terms of effort to give it. These
solutions can either buy or write yourself, agree? I see no reason to
give free solutions, which spent a lot of time - it is not free.

you are correct .

but video cache solution was very very simple when compared to the store id .
also it support couple of websites without  that much effort .

what i mean here is the simplicity &#8230;..im not in the development level &#8230; i talk about the normal squid users .

cheers

You take it and write on the basis of all that is needed. I do not see
any problem.

hey guys .

as long as the video cache has been opened now  and in past  proved its strength with http other websites for video .

((lets put youtube away now .))


why don&#8217;t we see development on it to support  the video contents of websites that support http  like daily motion and its sisters websites .


and why don&#8217;t we use certificates once development for youtube &amp; Facebook ???


i saw the development of eleizer of caching windows updates and it was great solution &#8230;.. why don&#8217;t we combine those 2 solution in 1 product ?


i  think that continuing on the solution of video cache is better than inventing solution from scratch .

thanks again squid users Guys

The cachevideos solution is not a fake but as Amos mentioned it might not have been updated\upgraded to match today state of YouTube and google videos.
I do not know a thing about this product but they offer a trial period and they have a forums which can be used to get more details.
I believe they still have something really good in their solution since it's not based on StoreID but on other concepts.

Yuri,

I am not the most experienced in life and in security but I can say it's possible and I am not selling it....
I released the windows update cacher which works in enough places(just by seeing how many downloaded it..).
The first rule I have learned from my mentors is that even if you know something it might not fit to be in a form that the general public should know about.
I am looking for a link to CVE related publication rules of thumb so I would be able to understand better what should be published and how.
Any redirections are welcomed..

A note:
If you have the plain html of a json which contains the next links you would be able to predict couple things...

I know what are you talking about. I came to this idea two years ago.
Unfortunately, I had more important priorities.
But I'm not seen open source solutions uses real YT internals yet and really works.

Now I'm working on another squid's thing, but plan to return to YT store-ID helper later.

However, it is only the fact that the &quot;solutions&quot; that are in the public domain, or obsolete, or are worthless.

And for some more money and asking. I would understand if they really worked. Unfortunately, Google does not idiots work.

That's why I said that the development of the Indian - fake.



If you would be able to catch every single fedora\redhat sqlite db file and replace it with a malicious sha256 data you would be able to hack each of their clients machine when they will be updated.
If you believe you can coordinate such a thing you are way above StoreID level of understanding networking and Computer Science.

Cheers,
Eliezer

Subject: Re: [squid-users] caching videos over https?

I do not want to waste my and your time and discuss this issue. I know what I know, I have seriously studied this issue. None of those who are really able to cache Youtube - not only on desktops but also on mobile devices - all without exception - is no solution in the form of open source or blob will not offer free. This is big money. As for Google, and for those who use it. Therefore, I suggest better acquainted with the way Youtube counteracts caching and close useless discussion.

I'm not going to shake the air and talk about what I do not and can not be. If you have a solution - really works, and for absolutely any type of client (Android and iPhone) - show evidence or let's stop blah-blah-blah. I mean, if you really were a solution - you'd sold it for money. But you do not have it, isn't it?

Personally, I do not want anything. This is not the solution I'm looking for. 

For myself, I found a workaround; what I know - I have stated in the wiki. If someone else wants to spend a year or two for new investigations - welcome.

Yuri,

Let say I can cache youtube videos, what would I get for this?
I mean, what would anyone get from this?
Let say I will give you a blob that will work, will you try it? Or 
would you want only an open source solution?

HTTPS is not a problem, if not a problem to install the proxy 
certificate to the clients.
The problem in combating caching YT by Google.

Only for strange definitions of &quot;fake&quot;.

It is simply an old helper from before YouTube became all-HTTPS. It 
should still work okay for any of the video sites that are still 
using HTTP.
YT uses cache-preventing scheme for videos relatively long time 
(after they finished use Flash videos). So, no one - excluding Google 
itself
- can cache it now. Especially for mobile devices. I've spent last 
two years to learn this. So, anyone who talk he can cache YT is lies.

As I explain here why:
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/YouTube/Dis">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/YouTube/Dis</A>
c
ussion

All another videos - well, this is a bit difficult - but possible to cache.


If you look at the features list it clearly says:
&quot;No support for HTTPS (secure HTTP) caching.&quot;
HTTPS itself in most cases can't be easy cached by vanilla squid.
