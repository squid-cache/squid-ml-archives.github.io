The helper example uses concurrency to reduce the number of children
needed. You enable that in squid.conf by adding &quot;concurrency=N&quot;
parameter to the *_children line. With N being the count of requests you
want it to handle at once.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the presented URL is already <A HREF="https://...,">https://...,</A> my assumption is that just
</I>&gt;<i> sending back a new line is all that squid needs to see?
</I>
Yes, an empty line for Squid-3.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, is all there any thing that I need to add besides the
</I>&gt;<i> url_rewrite_program and the number of children to the conf file?
</I>
Just the concurrency level if you want to use that. see above

&gt;<i>  What
</I>&gt;<i> about turning off url_rewrite_host_header?  The docs say this may be
</I>&gt;<i> wanted when running in accelerator mode.  I did a few quick tests in a
</I>&gt;<i> test setup and don't see any difference.
</I>
Nope, that is not relevant for proper redirectors.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, is the best way to test how many children to launch (5, 10, 20
</I>&gt;<i> etc) just to monitor the cache.log to see if squid is running out and
</I>&gt;<i> increase it until the messages go away?  
</I>&gt;<i> .....
</I>

You could do it that way. Better way is to look at the cachemgr report
about the redirectors. Each redirector should have a decreasing amount
of usage, if you arrange the numbers for concurrency and children so
that the Nth child has almost no lookups (at least less than its
concurency N value) under your highest expected traffic load it is
working fine.
