Unknown without a detailed log trace containing the full Squid
operations between the recorded lines.

Probably multiple objects using the same filename. That might also
explain why it is disappearing too (one got deeted, other entris not
aware of that). Although the filename does not start with 1D1C**** which
I would expect to see there given the path.
