    I don't know the sequence of actions needed to reliably trigger the 
above,
but the cache logs I have hand show counts of &quot;1&quot; for 99 of the &quot;no such 
file&quot;
errors, with the non-&quot;1&quot; counts being:
      2 /var/cache/squid/11/05/00011167
     12 /var/cache/squid/2C/34/0006CD0A
     33 /var/cache/squid/01/31/00001C56
     51 /var/cache/squid/25/06/000251AD
     71 /var/cache/squid/1D/1C/0001D708
In the oldest log rotated out on Sep 16, There are 6 with count 1, and 2 
with
&gt;<i>  1 counts:
</I>      6 /var/cache/squid/1D/1C/0001D708
      7 /var/cache/squid/25/06/000251AD

    In the large majority of cases, they are 1-time misses, but for 
some, like
&quot;/var/cache/squid/1D/1C/0001D708&quot;.  I don't see any that have the two 
cache dirs
as the 1st 2 digits -- I'd be surprised if it worked at all if that were 
the case -- maybe it isn't -- maybe I'm only getting memhits and the 
rest are hits
that would have come from disk if the file was there? 

    Which log would you want a detailed trace of... you talking debug 
level 9?  Erk?...


&gt;<i> Probably multiple objects using the same filename. That might also
