I do not understand what antivirus software has to do with our discussion.  
Please give details, don't just write &quot;...&quot;.

&gt;<i> So, I want all of that working
</I>
All of what?

&gt;<i> with my server ip address and for this reason I cannot use torproxy or
</I>&gt;<i> torproject. I need a proxy server (squid) on my server
</I>
In that case install Squid on your server.  What is the problem?

&gt;<i> More details about 173.161.0.227:
</I>&gt;<i> Its sophos web appliance that use squid on debian and using some other
</I>&gt;<i> proxy software (Astaro HttpProxy) with squid and

</I>&gt;<i> for download. so, i just have squid alone (although iptables is present)
</I>
Okay, so I understand that the machine on that IP address (which appears to be 
serving Pennoyer School in Illinois, with connectivity provided by Comcast) is 
a &quot;Sophos web appliance&quot; - some sort of combined firewall / proxy / port 
forwarder.

What is the relevance of that machine to your question?

&gt;<i> Please tell me that should i use other tools or squid can do it?
</I>
Do what?

Please explain exactly what it is you are trying to achieve, and hoping that 
Squid is a solution for.


Regards,


Antony.
