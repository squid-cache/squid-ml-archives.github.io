This is not true for apt-cacher-ng.  You install it and it does nothing.  You 
point your Debian (or Ubuntu, maybe other Debian-derived distros as well, I 
haven't tested) machines at it as their APT proxy, and it then caches content 
as it gets requested and downloaded.  Each machine which requests a new 
package causes that package to get cached.  Each machine which requests a 
cached package gets the local copy (unless it's been updated, in which case 
the cache gets updated).

This is exactly how apt-cacher-ng works.  I use it myself and I would 
recommend you investigate it further for this purpose.

That's a strange concept for a Debian repository (even third-party).

Are you sure you're talking about repositories and not just isolated .deb 
files?
