It depends on the ICAP service. Some work with requests, some with
responses, some with both kinds of messages.

If you are trying to manually decode ICAP traffic on a loopback
interface, please clarify what you are trying to accomplish with that.


&gt;<i> c)with ecap, I configured per

Just like with ICAP, you configure an eCAP adapter/service that you want
to use. I do not know whether it exists or needs to be written. For
example, if you want to find viruses, you can use an eCAP ClamAV adapter.


&gt;<i> I thought I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't need a service for ecap..do I point this to localhost or something?
</I>
With eCAP, you do not need a server. With both ICAP and eCAP you need a
service or &quot;adapter&quot; that does whatever you want to do. ICAP and eCAP
are just protocols/API -- they cannot do anything useful on their own.

The eCAP service URI is just an identifier. It does not &quot;point&quot; to any
specific location. It is only used to distinguish one loaded eCAP
service from another loaded eCAP service.


Overall, you need some software that will &quot;detect keywords&quot;. That
detection is not going to happen magically on its own. ICAP and eCAP are
just two ways to get the HTTP messages to that software. Some call that
_kind_ of software &quot;ICAP service&quot;, &quot;ICAP server plugin&quot;, &quot;eCAP service&quot;,
&quot;eCAP adapter&quot;, etc. You need to find or write a specific
service/plugin/adapter/etc. that does keyword detection.

Alex.
