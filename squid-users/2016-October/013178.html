</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; a Vary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;field with a &quot;*&quot; value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; [1] <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Please name the option in any version of Squid which allowed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Squid to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cache those &quot;Vary: *&quot; responses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No such option ever existed. For the 20+ years Vary has existed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Squid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; has behaved in the same way it does today. For all that time you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; did not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; notice these responses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are absolutely right, but there were not such abuse vector in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; past (at least in my practice). There were tools provided by devs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admins to protect against trending abuse cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What trend? There is exactly one mentioned URL that I'm aware of, the
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome browser download URL. I've posted two reasons why Chrome uses
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> Vary:* header. Just opinions of mine, but formed after actual
</I>&gt;<i> discussions with the Chrome developers some years back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [I very much dislike writing this. But you seem to have been sucked
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> and deserve to know the history.]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the fuss that is going on AFAICS was started by Yuri. His comment
</I>&gt;<i> history here and in bugzilla, and in private responses range from
</I>&gt;<i> non-compromising &quot;cache everything no matter what - do what I say,
</I>&gt;<i> now!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (repeatedy in unrelated bugzilla reports), &quot;f*ck the RFCs and anyone
</I>&gt;<i> following them, just store everything I dont care about what happens&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (this mornings post), to personal attacks against anyone who mentions
</I>&gt;<i> the previous stance might have problems (all the &quot;Squid developers
</I>&gt;<i> believe/say/...&quot; comments - none of which match what the team we have
</I>&gt;<i> actually said to him or believe).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is one other email address which changes its name occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> posts almost exactly the same words as Yuri's. So it looks to me as
</I>&gt;<i> Yuri
</I>&gt;<i> and some sock puppets performing a campaign to spread lies and FUD
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> Squid and hurt the people doing work on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly a good way to get people to do things for free. But it
</I>&gt;<i> seems
</I>&gt;<i> to have worked on getting you and a few others now doing the coding
</I>&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;<i> for him at no cost, and I have now wasted time responding to you and
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of a solution for it that might get accepted for merge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This particular topic is not the first to have such behaviour by
</I>&gt;<i> Yuri.
</I>&gt;<i> There have been other things where someone made a mistake (overlooked
</I>&gt;<i> something) and all hell full of insults broke loose at them. And
</I>&gt;<i> several
</I>&gt;<i> other cases where missing features in Squid did not get instant
</I>&gt;<i> obedience to quite blunt and insulting demands. Followed by weeks of
</I>&gt;<i> insults until the bug was fixed by other people - then suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> polite
</I>&gt;<i> Yuri comes back overnight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a developer, I personally decided not to write the requested code.
</I>&gt;<i> Not in the way demanded. This seems to have upset Yuri who has taken
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> insulting me and the rest of the dev team as a whole. I'm not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> he
</I>&gt;<i> is trolling to intentionally cause the above mentioned effects, or
</I>&gt;<i> really in need of medical assistance to deal with work related
</I>&gt;<i> stress.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [/history]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, the question arised,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what changed in Squid development policy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In policy: Nothing I'm aware of in the past 10 years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What changed on the Internet? a new bunch of RFCs came out, the
</I>&gt;<i> server
</I>&gt;<i> and clients Squid talks to all got updated to follow those documents
</I>&gt;<i> more closely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What changed in Squid? the dev team have been slowly adding the new
</I>&gt;<i> abilities to Squid. One by one, its only ~90% (maybe less) compliant
</I>&gt;<i> withe the MUST conditions, not even close to that on the SHOULDs,
</I>&gt;<i> MAYs,
</I>&gt;<i> and implied processing abilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think should happen to Squid when all the software it
</I>&gt;<i> talks
</I>&gt;<i> to speaks and expects what the RFCs say they should expect from
</I>&gt;<i> recipients/Squid ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the extreme this leads towards: You could easily write a
</I>&gt;<i> piece
</I>&gt;<i> of software that took HTTP requests and sent back random data that
</I>&gt;<i> looked vaguely like HTTP responses. But how useless that is when used
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> a proxy. So much for ignoring the HTTP specs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why there is no configuration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option like 'ignore_vary [acl]', so highly demanded by many users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK nobody has ever even proposed adding one until these past few
</I>&gt;<i> weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A proposals to ignore &quot;Vary: *&quot; has come up every few years, but when
</I>&gt;<i> the proposer was made aware of the server expectations as stated in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> RFC 2616 they went away, no attempt to go any further. So I assume
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> means it wasn't really a problem for them, not a serious one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In RFC 2616 (or older) compliant web there is no benefit to caching
</I>&gt;<i> these objects. The revalidate clause did not exist so the server can
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> expected to always produce a new one.
</I>&gt;<i> So what is gained by caching it? a waste of space other HIT's could
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> used better. Negative benefits really, not even zero gain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The middle sentence of that part of RFC 7231 has only existed for the
</I>&gt;<i> past few years. Even I had overlooked it until today. Sorry, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> been concentrating on getting Cache-Control going properly (no-cache
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> side effects are still a hot topic 4 years after it went in). Vary is
</I>&gt;<i> much broken in other serious ways, '*' storage seems a minor issue to
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also be aware that Squid is still in the process of moving from
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP/1.0
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour to HTTP/1.1 revalidation. We (Eduard, Alex and myself) have
</I>&gt;<i> not magically made everything work perfectly in one release. This is
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> of probably many cases where revalidation is potentially usable -
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> that nobody has coded it yet. Or cases which were previously
</I>&gt;<i> forbidden
</I>&gt;<i> and HTTPbis discussions (recent 7-ish years) shown that other vendors
</I>&gt;<i> are widely okay with it so its been allowed now by the 723x RFC
</I>&gt;<i> series.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As maintainer its my responsibility to point out the issues to anyone
</I>&gt;<i> even proposing a violation gets added. To make sure they are aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the expectations the servers and clients may have of Squid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All violation proposals get the same treatment (heck all patches get
</I>&gt;<i> this same treatment too, I'm just a little more lenient on compliance
</I>&gt;<i> increasing patches):
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- make the proposer aware of the problems they will cause,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;** my posts in reply to this and other threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- mention any alternatives (where available),
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;** others have mentioned eCAP/ICAP as better suited to such
</I>&gt;<i> violations.
</I>&gt;<i> That is exactly what those interfaces are designed for.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;** re-reading the section you quoted above, the middle sentence adds
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> possibility I overlooked earlier. You now have a potential direction
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> go without even doing any violation. The audit process shows its
</I>&gt;<i> worth
</I>&gt;<i> right there :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- and let them decide if it is worth the trouble to go forward.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;** so far mostly whats happened is a lot of complaints that &quot;Squid
</I>&gt;<i> dev
</I>&gt;<i> team&quot; are not providing things for free, on demand, to service a very
</I>&gt;<i> abusive and extremist person. Or just outright abuse. Seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> individual who started the discussions does not care about getting it
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> happen. You care more, and as you say below ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I'm no affected by the Vary abuse, but I suppose there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be increasing number of abuse cases in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Me neither (for seeing the problem in my sysadmin roles), so for both
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> us and many others it seems (to me) not to be a major problem. Or at
</I>&gt;<i> least not worth facing the consequences the proposed change risks
</I>&gt;<i> causing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can guess at what the future holds. But until we get there we
</I>&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;<i> dont know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My view of things includes years of app developer queries sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> IETF HTTPbis WG. There is an increasing number of applications that
</I>&gt;<i> *need* proxies to follow the spec requirements. I am not seeing them
</I>&gt;<i> much in the wild yet, but those applications are definitely around
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> breaking them could lead people to a lot of trouble.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW:&#160;&#160;The current spec for HTTP/1.1 is extremely tollerant. There
</I>&gt;<i> are a
</I>&gt;<i> very few places where it comes to an absolute inviolate rule. Those
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> cases which have very clear use-case mentioned in the spec and
</I>&gt;<i> problems
</I>&gt;<i> being avoided mentioned as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example the quoted section above about Vary. I overlooked that
</I>&gt;<i> middle sentance that has been added since 2616. That creates the
</I>&gt;<i> leeway
</I>&gt;<i> we need to cache the object within compliance. We are thusly allowed
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> treat &quot;Vary:*&quot; as another of the must-revalidate caching cases, just
</I>&gt;<i> like Cc:private or Authenticated responses.
</I>&gt;<i> (From the use-cases that have been mentioned in IETF WG about this
</I>&gt;<i> header, and cases people have been advised to use it I very much
</I>&gt;<i> doubt
</I>&gt;<i> any server will respond with 304 to such revalidation. But we might
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> lucky, or future servers might do so.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NP: all previous discussions and proposals of Vary:* handling came up
</I>&gt;<i> when 2616 was the spec to follow, and Squid did not do 1.1 much
</I>&gt;<i> anyway -
</I>&gt;<i> so using revalidation was not even on the horizon so to speak.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, back to me rant ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current specs were written by representatives standing for *all*
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> major browsers, *all* the major web servers, *all* the major
</I>&gt;<i> language/library frameworks, almost all the major command-line tools,
</I>&gt;<i> and many application developers as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it is not written in isolation by some few &quot;ivory tower types&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Yuri
</I>&gt;<i> would have you believe (yes some specs are - HTTP is not, or at least
</I>&gt;<i> those types are outnumbered for HTTP). The RFC 723x set is explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> collection of details about how the current HTTP applications
</I>&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;<i> found around the world *do* talk to each other today and how best to
</I>&gt;<i> exchange messages so the processing operations are understood at both
</I>&gt;<i> ends of the network connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The HTTP RFC's are effectively a description of current best
</I>&gt;<i> practice.
</I>&gt;<i> Violating is only useful if you are fixing some broken application
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> particular proxy has to deal with. All other cases are just causing
</I>&gt;<i> inefficiency and varying amounts of nasty depending on the violation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This latter point is part of why we require a clear use-case before
</I>&gt;<i> accepting violation patches - the need for it should be well thought
</I>&gt;<i> out. People who choose to violate that type of spec without a good
</I>&gt;<i> reason are just being stupid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The three persons (well, 2 use aliased email addresses - I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> actually one or two persons from the same region of the world)
</I>&gt;<i> providing
</I>&gt;<i> the most noise about Vary keep demanding it be provided for free.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answers confirmed my assumption regarding the question:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &#160;- there is a very high risk of copy-and-paste sysadmin spreading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; problems without realising what they are doing. Particularly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; since those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proposing it are so vocal about how great it *seems* for them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When someone else does the coding I act as both auditor and
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer.
</I>&gt;<i> The policies checked during audit do not go into good/bad judgements
</I>&gt;<i> -
</I>&gt;<i> just: code style, quality (no identifiable bugs) and a clear
</I>&gt;<i> statement
</I>&gt;<i> of the need behind the addition (for the merge repo comment to guide
</I>&gt;<i> future maintenance of that code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As maintainer I merge patches myself only if I'm happy to take on
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance for them, or supplier explicitly takes it on themselves
</I>&gt;<i> (ie
</I>&gt;<i> helper authors). Sometimes I get patches up to scratch in audit then
</I>&gt;<i> let
</I>&gt;<i> others merge, or advise they just be used as custom patches. In the
</I>&gt;<i> latter case we at least know that patch is not full of obvious bug
</I>&gt;<i> behaviours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But note so far *nobody* has submitted patches to audit about this.
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> has all just been a rather heated discussion in various unrelated bug
</I>&gt;<i> reports and some threads in this users list.

Hi Amos,

Thank you very much for so detailed explanation. I've made conclusions
from presented information. I deeply regret, that the topic took so
many time from you. I believe, information presented here will be
helpful for the community.

Nevertheless, the topic surfaced new details regarding the Vary and I
tried conditional requests on same URL (Google Chrome) from different
machines/IPs. Here results:
