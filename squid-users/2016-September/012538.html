<PRE>*Amos,*

Thanks for the reply but it seems i am not able to tell you what i
want to do. i don't want to cache repo files. i want to cache .zip
files only. i don't want .git file to cache but only .zip files which
are fetch from github.com,

Also you have said things about commits but i am talking about zip
file which is given by github via download button or composer fetches
those files via command line directly. as soon as someone commits zip
file's ETag is changed when you fetch it.

So there is no way to achieve this ? Do you think there is a way to
achieve this ?


*Consider: how does Squid know the ETag has changed on the
server?**What you know about things happening in RL is not what Squid
knows.*
&gt;<i> *I fact how do *you* know someone else did not commit a change during*
</I>&gt;<i> *that ~1 second it takes to look at the page and click the download button?** Simply, you don't, and cannot until the new object has been fetched.*
</I>&gt;<i> *Likewise, Squid cannot know if the object is the same until it has*
</I>&gt;<i> *fetched a MISS from the server. Except that Squid does not look at the*
</I>&gt;<i> *previous page content, so it cannot even 'see' if there is a commit*
</I>&gt;<i> *listed there that might be different since whenever it got the previous**object.*
</I>&gt;<i> *There is no Cache-Control or Expires header indicating a specific*
</I>&gt;<i> *storage timeout or revalidation procedure. So refresh_pattern defaults*
</I>&gt;<i> *will be used. These responses will be cached for the refresh_pattern**'Min' duration (900 minutes) before being considered for revalidated.*
</I>&gt;<i> *NP 1: Synthesizing Last-Modified from the Date header is only just being*
</I>&gt;<i> *fixed in Squid the past few weeks, and some parts of it still to be*
</I>&gt;<i> *committed. So I would not expect that response to be revalidated, just**re-fetched fully in older Squid.*
</I>&gt;<i> *NP 2: The Vary header indicates that every person logged in gets a*
</I>&gt;<i> *differently cached response based on how their credentials are hashed on*
</I>&gt;<i> *each request (in Authorization tokens). So caching these objects will*
</I>&gt;<i> *not help much with many developers involved. It will be of most help for**the anonymous visitors where username is always a generic NIL value.*
</I>&gt;<i> *HTH**Amos*
