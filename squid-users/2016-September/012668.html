cache_dir has nothing to do with access permissions. That is simply a
storage space for HTTP response objects.

So lets get this straight.

When you increased the number of concurrent logins the proxy could
process to be 20. The proxy started to work more happily handling ~20
concurrent users, at ~20 requests per second.


Hint: Does the number 20 occuring a lot in those values give you any
ideas about the problem?

Several things you can do (in this order of preference):

* upgrade to a supported Squid proxy version.
 3.1 is more than 5 years out of date. Current stable is 3.5.21. If your
operating system does not provide a more recent version it also needs to
be upgraded.

* ensure that persistent connections to clients is enabled.
 This will reduce the amount of authentications needed (thus alter the
helper load).

* increase the auth helper children value a bit more.
 Check the report (squidclient mgr:negotiateauthenticator) to see how
much each child is processing, the first should have a lot of uses, the
last none or nearly none. If the last child is handling many requests
then you could benefit from some more being started.
