&gt;<i> And how to do it?
</I>
I gave a specific example.


&gt;<i> To adapt the chain is only one access control list.
</I>
You are approaching this problem from the wrong angle: adaptation_access
rules are not attached to a specific adaptation service, set, or chain.
Those rules are like routing tables -- they send each message to one of
the existing services, sets, or chains (the first matching rule wins).
This is the same as cache_peer_access rules sending each message to a
specific cache peer. More on that below.


&gt;<i> How can I make a chain of adaptation with
</I>&gt;<i> different acl's for different chained services?
</I>
By configuring several chains and then writing adaptation_access rules
to select the right chain for a given message.


&gt;&gt;<i>   adaptation_service_chain vegetarianChain serviceA serviceB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   acl messageIsText ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   adaptation_access vegetarianChain messageIsText
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   adaptation_access serviceA all
</I>
&gt;<i> Here from this place can be a bit more detail. 
</I>
The above contains everything except for the messageIsText ACL
definition (which I do not know). Please let me know what other details
are missing...


&gt;<i> A service
</I>&gt;<i> receives all of the transactions, and the service B is limited to text
</I>&gt;<i> answers?
</I>
That is exactly what the above configuration accomplishes. Service A
receives all messages because this service is present no matter which
adaptation_access rule matches. Service B only receives messageIsText
messages (after they are processed by Service A).


&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Dynamic decision inside ServiceA:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Modify ServiceA to emit an appropriate ICAP X-Next-Services header
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [for text messages]. Do not forget to configure ServiceA with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routing=on! Search for X-Next-Services in squid.conf.documented.
</I>
&gt;<i> As I understand it, there is required a modification service code, right?
</I>
Yes, unless ServiceA already has some configuration options to
accomplish this.


&gt;<i> And is it possible specific example here:
</I>
A specific example for dynamic routing would be service A returning an
ICAP header like this:

  X-Next-Services: serviceB

(when and only when service A wants service B to be applied next). In
this case, Squid configuration becomes trivial:

  adaptation_access serviceA all


&gt;<i> #    routing=on|off|1|0
</I>&gt;<i> #        If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> #        dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
</I>&gt;<i> #        returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
</I>&gt;<i> #        are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
</I>&gt;<i> #        value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
</I>&gt;<i> #        Each named service should be configured in squid.conf. Other
</I>&gt;<i> #        services are ignored. An empty X-Next-Services value results
</I>&gt;<i> #        in an empty plan which ends the current adaptation.
</I>&gt;<i> #
</I>&gt;<i> #        Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
</I>&gt;<i> #        vectoring points in their natural processing order.
</I>&gt;<i> #
</I>&gt;<i> #        Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
</I>&gt;<i> #        response header is ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me personally, this paragraph does not explain anything.
</I>
I am sorry to hear that, but I cannot explain it better. Perhaps you can
ask specific questions and/or others can pitch in.



&gt;<i> we can not set
</I>&gt;<i> different access to services in the chain and the chain can have only
</I>&gt;<i> one level of access is the same for all the services within it?
</I>
Yes, dynamic routing aside, Squid builds a message adaptation plan and
then follows it. That plan is built at adaptation_access evaluation
time. That evaluation happens once per virgin message at each vectoring
point (REQMOD and RESPMOD). During that evaluation, the first
adaptation_access rule wins and the winning set/chain/service becomes
that adaptation plan.

There are some minor caveats like &quot;down&quot; services and adaptation plans
that span vectoring points, but I do not think they are important in
this context.



&gt;<i> Because then this assertion is contrary to the above.
</I>
I do not see a contradiction. What contradicts what, exactly?

Alex.
