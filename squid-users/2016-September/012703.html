Whether that is right or wrong depends on the specific ACLs. Also, there
is no need to create single-service chains. If your rulesA are mutually
exclusive with rulesB, then you can use them like this:

  adaptation_access serviceA rulesA
  adaptation_access serviceB rulesB
  adaptation_access chainAB all

However, again, I discourage you from saying &quot;chain_A with own access
rulesA&quot; because access rules do not belong to a chain. Squid evaluates
adaptation_access lines in the squid.conf order. Thus, if rulesA are NOT
mutually exclusive with rulesB, then the following configuration will
have a different effect from the above three lines:

  adaptation_access serviceB rulesB
  adaptation_access serviceA rulesA
  adaptation_access chainAB all

and this configuration does not make any sense at all:

  adaptation_access chainAB all
  adaptation_access serviceA rulesA
  adaptation_access serviceB rulesB


It is better to think like this:

  adaptation_access serviceA rules1
  adaptation_access serviceB rules2
  adaptation_access chainC rules3

serviceA is used when and only when &quot;rules1&quot; matches
serviceB is used when and only when &quot;!rules1 rules2&quot; matches
chainC is used when and only when &quot;!rules1 !rules2 rules3&quot; matches

Each message will be sent to either just serviceA, or just serviceB, or
just ChainC, or no services/chains/sets at all.


HTH,

Alex.
