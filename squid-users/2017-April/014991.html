Do you really want to log every packet hitting your machine?

What use is that information?

&gt;<i> -A INPUT -j DROP
</I>
That will prevent ALL packets from entering the machine - nothing can work.

You need to allow ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets before DROPping anything.

&gt;<i> Then allow
</I>&gt;<i> -A INPUT-i eth1 -j ACCEPT
</I>
There's no point putting a rule like this after &quot;INPUT -j DROP&quot;.  Everything 
has been DROPped already, whether it came from eth1 or not...

Remember that IPtables rules work on a &quot;first match wins&quot; basis.

&gt;<i> -A FORWARD -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
</I>
Er, wait, is this a forwarding router, or a Squid server accepting requests on 
eth1 and sending them out on eth0?

&gt;<i> but its block traffic. Can you please help me what allow rule will works
</I>&gt;<i> for Squid 3.5 when i secure my WAN.
</I>
Please give us more details of your network - I understand that the machien 
running Squid has two interfaces, but is it only ascting as a proxy, or is it 
also a forwarding router for other traffic?

Also, have you read any documantation on IPtables, to get some examples of 
standard configurations?


And finally, you numbered the question above with a &quot;1&quot;.  Is there a &quot;2&quot;?
