1. Which version of Squid?

2. What operating system / version is it running under?

3. How many clients access this proxy?

4. How many requests per {second|minute|hour} are you processing?

5. When you say &quot;enough disk space to store the cache&quot;, what are the details?

6. 4Gbytes is not a great deal these days - how much is being used, and do you 
have any swap (and is any of that being used)?

7. How often does the above behaviour occur?

8. Does it manifest itself immediately after starting Squid, or is there a 
longer period where it works normally before this starts happening?

9. Does it seem to occur after any specific requests have gone through, or when 
a specific request gets made?

10. What does access_log tell you about the requests immediately before, and 
during, the 30 second holdup?
