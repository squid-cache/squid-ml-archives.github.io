<PRE>Hey Cristopher,

I don't know where you are working or what is your TimeZone and I think that before you jump into any adventure attacking the subject I think it would be wise to understand the nature of the issue.

With my experience as an ISP sysadmin I can tell you that many of the issues your clients\users are having might not have any connection at all to things you can imagine or dream about.
The smart way that I believe is appropriate is to verify the current state of the system\setup and then understand what is required in order to do something about the relevant issues which you can overcome\improve.
There are issues which are not related to CS but to the brilliant minds of Hollywood or commercials like Google Chrome one about speed:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCgQDjiotG0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCgQDjiotG0</A>

and many others that are out there.

If you are up to the challenge of analyzing the current state of the system setup and find the right(both technical and in-budget) solution to your needs, whether if it exists already as an open source project or a ready to use product I will be happy to assist you with it.

If you are Interested to get a free consultation just send me a private email with your TZ and\or add the way you want and able to contact me.

My mobile is on the signature and I am also available at skype as: elico2013
Feel free to contact me also via telegram or whatsapp.

Subject: Re: [squid-users] Content Adaptation with HTTPs


The current solution doesn't work for me since it only supports a very 
limited number of clients.  I am working with a charity that provides 
internet services to those with impaired vision, the intention of my 
project was to set up a semi-public proxy for recipient of the charity 
(EG, we would install DD-WRT like routers within their homes that would 
create a tunnel into our network so that they could browse the internet 
using off-the-shelf systems.  We recently received a large number of 
tablets form a corporate donor, the tablets themselves will work for our 
recipients, but unfortunately the internet at large does not.

We've looked into commercial systems in the past, but we cannot afford 
the cost of commercial systems, especially since we are unsure about the 
exact licensing that would be needed for our endeavor.  We have also 
been burnt in the past with commercial software where the project either 
goes dead, begins to require insanely expensive appliances, or the 
license price is sent sky-high.

Would it be possible to use a setup of Squid &lt;-&gt; Privoxy &lt;-&gt; Squid to 
execute this?  I figure we'd build an internal instance that will handle 
the client&lt;-&gt;proxy part, Privoxy handles the content modification, then 
a second Squid instance to handle the web server&lt;-&gt;proxy part.

SO it looks like the solution would be to find a developer to write an 
ECAP to cycle through regexes to replace/remove HTML/CSS content.  So 
time to dig out my old C++ books and get to work...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am looking for guidance on doing Content Adaptation with https traffic
</I>&gt;<i> on my network to aid some accessibility systems like increasing the
</I>&gt;<i> contrast between text and the background (Modifying font color and
</I>&gt;<i> background tags, removing background images) or removing extraneous

</I>&gt;<i> auto-play from audio streams (So that the audio stream does not drown

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I am doing this AdBlockPlus + Element Hider and GreaseMonkey.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My goal here is to essentially do the same as those tools but for the
</I>&gt;<i> entire network so that these changes can still be applied for devices
</I>&gt;<i> that do not support extensions and the like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at the ICAP services available and nothing there will work for
