As they should, Good.

TLS/SSL is explicitly designed to break when being MITM'd. It is called 
security. When used properly it *cannot* by MITM'd, sadly most web 
traffic does not use it that way.

Are you using SSL-Bump functionality?

If not that is your problem. If you are, what is your config?
