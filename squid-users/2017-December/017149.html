Okay, understood.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; These groups and users are in a remote server

Er, okay...

Okay, I guess it might be possible to get Squid to use ACLs based on the 
result of an HTTP request, but I've never seen it done like this before.

Maybe someone else on the list can suggest how this might be made to work.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so with I have created a helper for authorization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tell us how this helper works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that using a helper for autorization I can restricted the pages
</I>&gt;<i> used for each member group
</I>
Have you created a helper, or not?

If you have created one, please tell us how it works.

&gt;<i> &gt; How does it identify one group from another?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uhm...the structere are differents , really there are in different tables
</I>&gt;<i> in my DB that is in the server
</I>
So, you're doing an HTTP request to a web server, which then looks up the user 
in a database, and returns a result as an HTTP response...

Surely it would be easier (and quicker / more efficient) to get Squid to 
interrogate the database?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the problem is how can i do this ACL
</I>
I wouldn't start from there, so I hope someone else here can suggest a way of 
getting this to work.


What made you start with this approach in the first place?
