1. What type of accesses do you want to avoid having in the Squid logs (and 
incidentally, why - what's wrong with these requests going through Squid)?

2. The only way I can think of you being able to do this with Squid would be 
to set up a hierarchy - one &quot;front-end&quot; Squid server which does no caching 
(I'm assuming this is part of what you want to achieve), and then either does 
&quot;direct&quot; accesses to the origin server (for the requests you don't want Squid 
to process), or &quot;parent&quot; accesses to the &quot;back-end&quot; caching Squid server, for 
the ones you are happy to go through Squid.  You then regard the &quot;back-end&quot; 
server as your &quot;real Squid server&quot; and treat the &quot;front-end&quot; machine as just a 
way of routing the requests according to your rules.

3. Is the thing you are really trying to achieve &quot;not having the requests show 
up in Squid's log files&quot; or &quot;not being processed by Squid&quot;?  What's the reason 
for whichever one this is - what is the problem with the way things are 
working now which you are trying to solve?
