^^ localnet and localhost are permitted, nothing else.

You need to find out what other access Selenium requires and how it can 
reliably be identified. Then add http_access rules here to allow it.


&gt;<i> # And finally deny all other access to this proxy
</I>&gt;<i> http_access deny all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # Squid normally listens to port 3128
</I>&gt;<i> http_port 3128

</I>&gt;<i> debug_options rotate=1 ALL,2/

</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas what I should look at for more information? Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

The access.log records the connection details for the failed requests. 
You should usually be able to find most of the details necessary there.
