<PRE>You'r welcome.

I do not understand what the hell you have clung to me. I have my own
point of view on the problem. Tell tales of the guy who started this
thread. I know the developer's position.

So, let's stop useless discussion. This is wasted time only.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you do not want to violate the RFC - remove violations HTTP at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you remember, this mode is now enabled by default.
</I>&gt;<i> That mode does not mean what you seem to think it means.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It means that *some* *specific* things which are known not to cause much
</I>&gt;<i> damage are allowed which violate HTTP _a little bit_ when it helps the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic work better. Most things it does is enabling Squid to detect and
</I>&gt;<i> talk with broken software that are themselves not quite following HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> right.
</I>&gt;<i>  For example, a client forgetting to %20 some whitespace inside a URL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You do not have to teach me that I use. I - an administrator and wish to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be able to select tools. And do not be in a situation where the choice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is made for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried starting regular conversations with your friends and
</I>&gt;<i> family with the words &quot;F*k you, man, I'm the System Administrator&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> they know that your way is always right no matter what. Then proceeding
</I>&gt;<i> to say everything else in the conversation at the loudest volume your
</I>&gt;<i> mouth can produce while injecting weird words randomly into each
</I>&gt;<i> sentence? just because you were created with those abilities you might
</I>&gt;<i> as well try using them. It definitely will make conversations short and
</I>&gt;<i> efficient (hmm.. just like 100% caching makes HTTP 'quick').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, my point is all languages have rules and protocols of behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> that have to be followed for the sentences/messages to be called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;speaking&quot; that language. If you don't follow those rules you are simply
</I>&gt;<i> not speaking that language. You might be speaking some other language or
</I>&gt;<i> just being a weirdo - either way you are not speaking that language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP is as much a language as any spoken one. It is just for Internet
</I>&gt;<i> software to 'talk' to each other. By not following its rules you are ...
</I>&gt;<i> well ... not using HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you keep saying about how you/admin &quot;must&quot; be allowed to violate
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP just because you are administrator and want to. That makes as much
</I>&gt;<i> sense as being proud about shouting at everyone you talk to in real
</I>&gt;<i> life. It's dumb, on a scale that demonstrates one is not worthy of the
</I>&gt;<i> privilege of being a sysadmin and can lead to early retirement in a
</I>&gt;<i> small padded cell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Antonio, you've seen at least once, so I complained about the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consequences of my own actions?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You seem to continually complain that people are recommending not to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> try going
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> against standards, or trying to defeat the anti-caching directives on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> websites
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you find.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's your choice to try doing that; people are saying &quot;but if you do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that, bad
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things will happen, or things will break, or it just won't work the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> way you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want it to&quot;, and then you say &quot;but I don't like having to follow the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rules&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's what I meant about complaining about the consequences of your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is my right and my choice. Personally, I do not complain of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consequences, having enough tools to solve any problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hahahahaha &quot;not complain about the consequences&quot;, ROFLMAO.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks dude, I needed a good laugh today.
