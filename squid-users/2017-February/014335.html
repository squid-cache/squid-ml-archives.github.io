Sorry, what do you mean by &quot;IP access&quot;?

I assume both Squid servers have IP addresses.

Do you mean that only one of them has connectivity to the Internet?

What do you mean by &quot;the other one has users&quot;?

Is it doing some sort of authentication, or do you simply mean that this is 
the one the users have connectivity to, so that your network arrangement is:

users -&gt; Squid box 1 -&gt; Squid box 2 -&gt; router -&gt; Internet

...and that the users cannot connect to Squid box 2, and Squid box 1 cannot 
connect to the Internet.

Is that a reasonable description of your setup?

&gt;<i> (the machine users are configure with &quot;proxy.blabla.lan&quot; (the squid with ip
</I>&gt;<i> access)
</I>
I don't think I uderstand that bit.

&gt;<i> I want to know if it is possible do balance between them.
</I>
Please define &quot;balance&quot;?

&gt;<i> The problem, for me it is that the &quot;server with ip access&quot; it is refer with
</I>&gt;<i> a A dns record that point to his ip (proxy.blabla.lan)... and the &quot;squid
</I>&gt;<i> with user access&quot;, the dns it is pointing with fqdn (squid.blabla.lan)....
</I>
Okay, so the two machines have DNS A records for different hostnames.

&gt;<i> So, i cant do a multiple A record, pointing to the two ip, because, one of
</I>&gt;<i> the squid servers wait a fqdn answer...
</I>
Why can't you do a multiple A record?

There's nothing wrong with:

proxy.blabla.lan	A	192.168.38.56

squid.blabla.lan	A	192.168.38.73

example.blabla.lan	A	192.168.38.56
				A	192.168.38.73

So that example.blabla.lan points to both IP addresses.

&gt;<i> I tried to do  CNAME but, its not working... (i tried to do
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;proxy.blabla.com pointing to squid.blabla.com at the same time that the ip
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;ip access squid server&quot;)
</I>
No, you are not allowed to have a CNAME in DNS as well as any other record (A, 
MX, NS, etc).  If something is a CNAME, it cannot also be anything else.

&gt;<i> (hope this understood, i dont speak english)
</I>
I think you're doing okay, but please clarify the things requested above :)

Also, please simply tell us: what are you trying to achieve?  It's often the 
case that someone is trying to solve a problem, thinks of a possible solution, 
and asks on a mailing list such as this for help in implementing the 
solutions, when there is actually a far better / simpler solution to the 
problem available.  However, because the problem itself was not stated, nobody 
can propose the better / simpler solution, and everyone just works towards 
making the poorer solution work somehow or other...

Antony.
