&quot;In theory, you must either import your root certificate into browsers or instruct users on how to do that. Unfortunately, it is apparently a common practice among well-known Root CAs to issue subordinate root certificates. If you have obtained such a subordinate root certificate from a Root CA already trusted by your users, you do not need to import your certificate into browsers. However, going down this path may result in removal of the well-known Root CA certificate from browsers around the world. Such a removal will make your local SslBump-based infrastructure inoperable until you import your certificate, but that may only be the beginning of your troubles. Will the affected Root CA go after you to recoup their world-wide damages? What will your users do when they learn that you have been decrypting their traffic without their consent?&quot; 

The last sentence is ambiguous the users can known, you can inform that you have been decrypting their traffic. 
There is no difference (from user point of view I mean) between a well-known Root CAs or a self-signed certificate with a CA injected by a local GPO. 
 
But in practice I don't how how you can do that, just hello I want a subordinate root certificates ?
