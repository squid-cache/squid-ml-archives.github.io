What happens if you use Squid as an HTTPS proxy rather than an HTTP
proxy? In other words, can you configure your client to connect over SSL
to Squid's https_port instead of connecting over plain TCP to Squid's
http_port? After that connection is established, the client will send
CONNECT in both cases, but perhaps the &quot;network&quot; will not reset the SSL
connection to Squid because it would not be able to see HTTP[S]
transaction boundaries inside that SSL connection?

If SSL connections to Squid are prohibited on your network, and only one
HTTP transaction is allowed per HTTP connection, then I cannot think of
a way to send standard HTTPS requests through a standard HTTP proxy.

Alex.
