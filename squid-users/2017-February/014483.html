Why?  What's the problem with the clients knowing the true values?

It doesn't sound to me like the VMs are actually part of what you're trying to 
do here?  You're just talking about client connections to hypervisors; the VMs 
are not part of that.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to achieve this with squid?
</I>
What protocol do the clients use to communicate with the KVM Hypervisors?

If it's HTTP, HTTPS or FTP, then you can probably configure Squid in 
accelerator mode and use it to do what you want.

However, why are you trying to do this?  What is the risk involved in the 
clients knowing the true IPs and ports of the hypervisors, which would be 
mitigated by having them connect via a proxy instead?

Have you considered using HAproxy or LVS, both of which are far more generic 
network proxies than Squid is?

&gt;<i> Is there any example how to configure this?
</I>
Not that I have ever heard of, however if it is a protocol which Squid can 
handle, it really doesn't matter what the specific backend system is; there are 
plenty of examples on how to do HTTP, HTTPS and FTP.
