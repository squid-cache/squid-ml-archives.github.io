&gt;<i> Does it has changes in the configuration from Squid 3.5.20 vs 3.5.24 ?

I see one configuration change clearly identified in ChangeLog:

&gt;<i> - TLS: Make key= before cert= an error instead of quietly hiding the issue
</I>
There may be more -- I have not checked closely.


&gt;<i> My Squid stop working for no reason BUT i dont know why. To fix that, I
</I>&gt;<i> have to restart the Squid process.
</I>
When &quot;Squid stopped working&quot;,

* Was Squid process still running?
* What was the Squid process state (running, sleeping, blocked, etc.)?
* Was the Squid process CPU usage at or very close to 100%?
* Was the Squid process memory usage abnormal?
* Was anything potentially relevant logged at the end of cache.log?
* Was anything potentially relevant logged in system logs?
* Did telnet from localhost to Squid listening port work?
* Was Squid responding to local cache manager requests?
* Did curl/wget/squidclient from localhost to Squid listening port work?

I realize that you may not know the answer to many of these questions,
but you can consult this list when/if this happens again, so that you
can troubleshoot the problem yourself or supply relevant information to
others on the mailing list.

It is very rare for Squid to &quot;stop working&quot; without at least some
visible symptoms of the underlying problem.


HTH,

Alex.
