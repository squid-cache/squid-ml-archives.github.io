It is used for chain completion. *which* chain is being completed 
depends on the traffic mode.

clientca= should be the one used *only* for client cert verification (I 
think). But neither was used consistently in Squid-3, so YMMV based on 
the traffic modes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From a client perspective you can quickly grab the whole chain with

</I>&gt;<i> I have to disagree with this. The anchor (CA1) is discarded regardless.
</I>&gt;<i> It cannot be used. If included it bloats the TLS handshake. Even 
</I>&gt;<i> openssl
</I>&gt;<i> will discard it and then look in the trusted CA store.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see with a packet cap that the mimicked server cert and the signing
</I>&gt;<i> cert are both included even without the cafile option specified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So is it safe to say that the referenced wiki page has just become

</I>&gt;<i> clients, CA1 signs CA2 which signs CA3 which is used as MITM cert,
</I>&gt;<i> cafile=CA2)
</I>
That wiki page was incorrect at the time of creation. But the author 
refuses to agree that root cert are discarded so I left it there instead 
of inciting an edit war. Saving the root CA into the file should be 
harmless anyway.
