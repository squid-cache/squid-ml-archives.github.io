<PRE>Thank you Amos. I agree that adding the anchor is generally harmless and
you've chosen your battles wisely.
Also thank you Garri. I must have missed your response confirming the same.

For current squid versions the wiki page is misleading according to all
credible references I can find. Any application failing because the root
is missing is buggy itself and that is not a squid problem. There are
several very good arguments for excluding it, including to expose bad
apps. Trusting a root cert sent from a server is like trusting a
politician because all promises end with &quot;trust me&quot;.

I'll submit a request for the description of cafile/tls-cafile to change
and move the discussion to there.

Thanks all,
Senor

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If the client has CA1 installed as a trust anchor then technically you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't need to send CA1 as it is discarded by the client once the trust
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> relationship for CA2 is established.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's good practice to send the full chain though as it makes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> troubleshooting easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From a client perspective you can quickly grab the whole chain with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> openssl s_client and check if CA1 is in the trust store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have to disagree with this. The anchor (CA1) is discarded regardless.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It cannot be used. If included it bloats the TLS handshake. Even openssl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will discard it and then look in the trusted CA store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see with a packet cap that the mimicked server cert and the signing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cert are both included even without the cafile option specified.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So is it safe to say that the referenced wiki page has just become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outdated? If cafile is used to fill in the cert chain it wouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed unless there were additional intermediate certs between the mitm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cert and the trusted CA known to the client. (As in CA1 is trusted by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients, CA1 signs CA2 which signs CA3 which is used as MITM cert,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cafile=CA2)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That wiki page was incorrect at the time of creation. But the author
</I>&gt;<i> refuses to agree that root cert are discarded so I left it there instead
</I>&gt;<i> of inciting an edit war. Saving the root CA into the file should be
</I>&gt;<i> harmless anyway.
