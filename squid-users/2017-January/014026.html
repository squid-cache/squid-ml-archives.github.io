How are you measuring that 200ms?

&gt;<i> the question here :
</I>&gt;<i> why icmp timeout is 10ms  ?
</I>&gt;<i> but http timeout is 200 ms ?
</I>
1. &quot;Timeout&quot; is the wrong term here.  It's more accurate to say &quot;response 
time&quot;.

&quot;Timeout&quot; means that something failed because it took too long, whereas what 
you're measuring here is the time taken before it succeeded.


2. Why is the HTTP response time higher than the ICMP response time?

Because compared to ping running over ICMP, HTTP is a complicated protocol, 
running over TCP, which is a complicated, multi-stage protocol, and the 
response has to be generated by an application on the remote server, which is 
probably fetching content from a storage device in order to send it to you.

An ICMP ping requires just a single packet from your machine to the target, a 
simple response in the network stack, and a single packet back to you in 
return.

&gt;<i> is there  a way in squid to make it faster and few http ms like 30 ms ?
</I>
It's not Squid which is taking the time - it's the remote server - try 
measuring it without Squid in place and see what the response time is.
