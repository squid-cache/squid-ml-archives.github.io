&quot;reliability&quot; has nothing to do with it. You are talking about
redesigning the fundamental definition of how a message is framed. In
direct violation of how the rest of the HTTP talking Internet communicates.
 &lt;<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3</A>&gt;

DO NOT do that.

&gt;<i> customization was kinda easy,
</I>
Of course, changing code is the easy part. Getting it right is much harder.

For example you seem to think that \r\n\r\n is the end of a request.

It is actually the MIME terminator and occurs at what the syntax defines
as the *middle* of an HTTP message frame - between the MIME and payload
sections.

The MIME section is a sub-frame within HTTP messages. It is optional
(either non-existing or empty) and may be used in any of the three major
HTTP message types.

Payload is a rare occurance on GET requests, which I suspect is where
your mistakes is coming from. But there is actually an implicit
Content-Length:0 header in GET requests making the payload section not
visible when looking at traffic.

Beyond that, mime sections are also used by several other protocols that
Squid implements. We re-use code for common protocol parsing so the code
you are changing probably affects _all_ of those protocols.


&gt;<i> now I want it to remove the characters after
</I>&gt;<i> a spesific character in request uri, and to remove a spesific character
</I>&gt;<i> which is placed at the end of all headers (before \r\n).
</I>
So what you actually have is your very own non-HTTP custom messaging
syntax. Please stop modifying Squid's HTTP parsing logics.

For a custom protocol (lets call it Foo for now) you should create your
own Foo namespace and one (or more) Foo::Parser classes that do the
message decapsulation in accordance with your protocols syntax.

You can inherit from or use an instance of the Http1::RequestParser if
you want to re-use some of its HTTP logics. But do not re-write the HTTP
logic to do non-HTTP things. Because, as I mentioned above there are
other protocols also re-using that same HTTP logic.


&gt;<i> Which source files
</I>&gt;<i> I need to edit, do anyone know ? Or is there any link in which I can find
</I>&gt;<i> references to source code which are related to request parsing ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The Squid developers can be contacted through the squid-dev mailing
list. This list is for network administrators to discuss and get help
*operating* Squid properly.
