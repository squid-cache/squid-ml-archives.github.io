If my reconstruction of the events was correct, then OpenSSL supplied as
much information as it could -- the &quot;unsupported TLS/SSL versions&quot; is
_your_ conclusion based on the information that neither Squid nor
OpenSSL had access to.

It takes two to tango. How silent that failure is depends, in part, on
the server. AFAICT, your server was 100% silent about the reason behind
its abrupt connection closure, and OpenSSL correctly declined to
speculate about those reasons due to lack of info. From OpenSSL/client
point of view, it could have been anything from an unsupported TLS
version to a crashed server.

Glad you figured it out!

Alex.
