That should remind you of OS X and Android as well, at the very least (and 
quite possibly systemd as well)

My opinion is that it's your choice whether to run Microsoft Windows (or Apple 
OS X, or Google Android) or not - but you have to accept it as a whole 
package; you can't say &quot;I want some of the neat features, but I want them to 
work *my* way&quot;.

If you don't accept all aspects of the package, then don't use it.

&gt;<i> Antonio, you've seen at least once, so I complained about the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of my own actions?
</I>
You seem to continually complain that people are recommending not to try going 
against standards, or trying to defeat the anti-caching directives on websites 
you find.

It's your choice to try doing that; people are saying &quot;but if you do that, bad 
things will happen, or things will break, or it just won't work the way you 
want it to&quot;, and then you say &quot;but I don't like having to follow the rules&quot;.

That's what I meant about complaining about the consequences of your actions.
