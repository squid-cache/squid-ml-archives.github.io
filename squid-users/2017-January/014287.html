</I>
Under a narrow set of splice conditions you can get traffic through the
2-proxy heirarchy. But that is a very limited set of circumstances and
definitely not working with 'bump' anywhere involved.

As Alex pointed out step3 also eliminates the CONNECT ability. Which I
was not aware of a year ago when I wrote that original email you referenced.


The problem is that *any* server or peer TLS communication prior to
deciding to splice eliminates the ability to use a fake-CONNECT. That is
absolute because *all* TLS server/peer communication has to go through
the CONNECT tunnel - or none can. Anything happening prior to its
existence wont be TLS authenticated with the origin server.

They did not because Squid _cannot_ do it.

Note that their cache_peer has 'ssl' flag enabled. So their transparent
traffic is using the peer certificate to base the auto-generated certs
on. Which you already tried and decided was not workable for you.
