Okay, that will remove the distribution (Debian or Debian-based) package.

&gt;<i> then I downloaded squid-3.5.24 in browser
</I>
What exactly did you download from where?

&gt;<i> unpacked it
</I>
So, presumably this was some source code tarball?

&gt;<i> then &quot;sudo auto-apt run ./configure &amp;&amp; sudo make &amp;&amp; sudo checkinstall&quot;.
</I>
That looks like a rather bizarre combination of a Distribution command (auto-
apt run) and a distribution-independent configure &amp; build (but not an 
installation of the resulting binary), followed by a checkinstall (which is 
designed to create an installable object, but dow not install it).

My biggest question here is &quot;where did you find the instructions telling you to 
run that combination of commands?&quot;

&gt;<i> deb package is created, message says that it was also installed.
</I>
Show us the message.

&gt;<i> So i ran command
</I>
What command?

&gt;<i> to see installed packages and that's what I get:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> squid-common
</I>&gt;<i> squid-langpack
</I>&gt;<i> squid3
</I>&gt;<i> squid3-common
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I run any command with &quot;squid3&quot; it says that squid3 is not installed,
</I>&gt;<i> but &quot;squid -v&quot; gives me &quot;Squid Cache: Version 3.1.19&quot;. Also there is no
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;squid&quot; or &quot;squid3&quot; service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What am I doing wrong?
</I>
You are getting horribly confused between installing a distribution-packaged 
version, and compiling your own binary from source.

&gt;<i> What should I do to get this 3.5.24 version to work and also have squid
</I>&gt;<i> service?
</I>
1. Tell us which Linux distribution and version you are running.

2. Use you distribution's package manager to remove the packages you currently 
have installed:

	squid-common
	squid-langpack
	squid3
	squid3-common

3. Make sure they really have been removed, by running:

	find / -name &quot;squid*&quot;

Remove anything that command finds on your system.

4. If you really want version 3.5.24, check whether that is available for your 
distribution and if it is, install it through your package manager.

If that version is not available, and you're not happy to install whatever the 
latest version for your distribution is, follow the instructions at 
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid</A>

5. Return here with copy/pasted commands and output if you need further help.


Regards,


Antony.
