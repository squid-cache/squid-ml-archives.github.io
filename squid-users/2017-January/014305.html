Okay, so that's an official source tarball, good.

&gt;<i> 3. About &quot;sudo auto-apt run ./configure &amp;&amp; sudo make &amp;&amp; sudo checkinstall&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to give it a shot, original command was &quot;sudo ./configure &amp;&amp;
</I>&gt;<i> make &amp;&amp; sudo make install&quot;
</I>
That latter command would have been *far* more sensible (provided you remember 
the extra sudo in the middle) - it would configure, build and install the 
version you just downloaded from the Squid website.

&gt;<i> 4. Command to list packages: dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall
</I>
Okay, that'll tell you what Ubuntu thinks has been installed via the package 
manager.

&gt;<i> 5. Like Amon has written: &quot;Please upgrade. 3.1 is over 5 years outdated and
</I>&gt;<i> the OS it was written for wont even have LTS support for very much longer.
</I>&gt;<i> All the newer versions should come pre-packaged with eCAP support with no
</I>&gt;<i> action needed on your part.&quot;
</I>
Yes, I completely agree you should upgrade from Squid 3.1

You might also consider upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04... :)

&gt;<i> So I wanted the newest stable release and that is 3.5.24
</I>
&gt;<i> 6. I've deleted every squid-related package with dpkg (what about this one,
</I>&gt;<i> should I delete it too?: /usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax/squid.vim)
</I>
No, that's just an editor syntax rules file, for &quot;intelligent&quot; highlighting 
when you edit the Squid config file.

Leave it or delete it; it's nothing to do with installing or running Squid.

&gt;<i> 7. Inside unpacked squid folder I used ./configure that is at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> this post &amp;&amp; sudo make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</I>
Now *that* sounds good.

&gt;<i> 8. Command from 4. doesn't show that squid is installed
</I>
No, it won't, because you didn't install it through the package manager.

&gt;<i> however, &quot;squid -v&quot; shows
</I>&gt;<i> Squid Cache: Version 3.5.24
</I>&gt;<i> Service Name: squid
</I>
Excellent.

&gt;<i> 9. When I go to /etc/init.d and type &quot;squid&quot; I get no error (I got earlier
</I>&gt;<i> because there was no cache.log file in /var/log/squid3)
</I>
Do you really mean &quot;squid&quot; or do you mean &quot;./squid&quot;?

If it's the first, I don't understand the relevance of being in /etc/init.d

&gt;<i> 10. I can run squid -z to create directories
</I>
Good.

&gt;<i> 11. there is no squid service on the list using &quot;service --status-all&quot;
</I>
What do you get from the following:

	/etc/init.d/squid status
	/etc/init.d/squid restart


Basically I think you are doing very well now.


Antony.
