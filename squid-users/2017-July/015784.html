Has Squid been upgraded during that time?

What version is it running, and on what operating system / version?

&gt;<i> suddenly got a ERROR in user sides.

</I>
Where do the user machines point to for DNS resolution?

&gt;<i> after restarting squid service for a little short time squid works but

</I>
What makes you think that a DNS resolution problem is caused by Squid, and 
that restarting Squid might help?

&gt;<i> Squid Service works on ubuntu box too but no browsing.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;Squid works&quot; &quot;but no browsing&quot;?  What does &quot;Squid works&quot; 
mean if people cannot browser websites?

&gt;<i> why it can happen suddenly without any change to server?
</I>
I would guess there has been a change elsewhere.


1. Does web browsing work if you bypass Squid and connect to the Internet 
directly?

2. What are the user machines pointing at for their DNS resolution?

3. What does the Squid machine point to for its DNS resolution?

4. Can you resolve hostnames at the command line on the Squid machine?

5. Give us a bit of information about your network - what's the IP address of 
the Squid server, how does it connect to the Internet, what's the IP range of 
your client machines, what are you using for a router, do you run your own DNS 
server on the network, anything else you think might be helpful.

Antony.
