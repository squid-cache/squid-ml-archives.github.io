Possibly. Google have actively been making it more difficult every year 
for quite a while.

These days it requires intercepting the YouTube HTTPS connections. That 
is only possible if the clients are not using Chrome or other Google 
apps to fetch the videos - otherwise you run up against the cert pinning 
wall.

After that you need some extra helper software to track the YT video 
fetching process and decipher what the actual video URL is from the mess 
of session traffic. That is being kept a bit of a secret these days, 
since every time G find out how it is being done they change the process 
to make it more obtuse and harder to do :-(

Eliezer has been trying to get a helper for that going most recently. 
There are also some other products I forget the name of right now 
(videobooster maybe), but should be easy to find that cache YouTube content.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as hardware I have 2 options:

</I>&gt;<i> 2. I have an old server hardware with more power than RPI 3, but I don't

</I>&gt;<i> can upgrade it to latest FreeBSD (11?) and isntall squid application 
</I>&gt;<i> that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does squid run on RPI3?  FreeBSD?
</I>
Yes to both, and at the small scale you need the RPi3 should be able to 
cope with it.
