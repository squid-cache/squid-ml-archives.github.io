</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The changes in 3.5.21 were fixes to some common crashes and better caching behaviour. So I expect at least some of the change is due to higher traffic throughput on proxies previously restricted by those problems.

More requests per second generally means more TCP connections churning.

Also when going from Squid-2 to Squid-3 there is a change from HTTP/1.0 
to HTTP/1.1 and the accompanying switch from MISS to near-HIT 
revalidations. Revalidations usually only have headers without payload 
so the same bytes/sec can contain orders more magnitude of those than 
MISS - which is the point of having them.


&gt;<i> In our prod environment when we updated from 2.7.x to 3.5.25 we saw increase from 100 to 10000. This is 100x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Compared to what RPS change? Given the above traffic change this may be 
reasonable for a v2 to v3 jump. Or own very rough tests on old hardware 
lab tests have shown rates for Squid-2 at ~900 RPS and Squid-3 at around 
1900 RPS.


&gt;<i> When I was load testing different versions yesterday I was always sending the same amount of RPS to them. Update from 3.5.20 to 3.5.21 resulted in jump from 20 to 10000 TIME_WAIT count. This is 500x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that time_wait is fine in general. Until you have too many of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
At this point I'd check that your testing software supports HTTP/1.1 
pipelines. It may be giving you worst-case results with per-message TCP 
churn rather than what will occur normally (pipelines of N requests per 
TCP connection).
Though seeing such a jump between Squid-3 releases is worrying.
