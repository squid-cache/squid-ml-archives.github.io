That depends entirely on whether the modified version has been distributed or 
not.

If whoever has done the modifications uses the modified version only for their 
own use, that is entirely in keeping with the GPL.

The GPL only says that you must make available the source code of your 
modifications for any modified version which you distribute to others.

&gt;<i> Your sponsor may have *serious blame* from the open source community

Please read it more closely, specifically sections 2 and 6, paying attention to 
the word &quot;distribute&quot;.
