erdosain9: the above should be what you need.

If not, then you may still be distracted by thinking that Squid has any 
relevance to the &quot;gateway&quot;.

What you need to start with is that the machine which will _later_ be 
running Squid - be _first_ setup as a gateway router on your network. 
That has nothing to do with Squid and the details should be available in 
any general networking sysadmin guide.

The key thing is that all your clients traffic routing should be 
operational and going through that machine *before* you go anywhere near 
even installing Squid on that machine.

Only after that gateway is setup and operational do you install Squid 
and add the iptables bits to get the traffic into Squid. The Squid wiki 
examples are intended for use by someone already somewhat familiar with 
network configuration and wanting to do that extra step with the proxy.

The Diladele page(s) go through much more of the full process of setting 
up the gateway machine, but remember that most of what you are wanting 
is not about Squid at all - so don't skip parts thinking they are 
irrelevant to your proxy.
