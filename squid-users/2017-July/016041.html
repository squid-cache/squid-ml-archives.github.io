Not sure what you are asking there. Squid *is* the proxy in the middle, 
so terminate does a TCP close().

Squid does not support relaying decrypted <A HREF="https://">https://</A> requests over an 
insecure connection. So HTTP cache_peer connections will be refused.

Also, when TLS cache_peer is used Squid is unable to tell the difference 
between the peer TLS server details an origin. So any server-cert 
forging uses the cache_peer's server cert instead of the origin.

In Squid-3.5 (and v4) explicit/forward proxy it is best not to use 
cache_peer for decrypted content. The most working way for now is to let 
it go 'DIRECT' and repeat the intercept at the peer.

Are you trying to describe something like a CARP hierarchy?
&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/SmpCarpCluster">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/SmpCarpCluster</A>&gt;

They suffer from the above problem. There is no good solution for that 
in current Squid versions which do SSL-Bump.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> acl step1 at_step SslBump1
</I>&gt;<i> acl step2 at_step SslBump2
</I>&gt;<i> acl step3 at_step SslBump3
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump stare step1 all
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump stare step2 allowed_https_sites
</I>&gt;<i> #ssl_bump bump step3
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump terminate step2 all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Up to you, but I would do this:

  ssl_bump peek step1

  ssl_bump stare step2 allowed_https_sites
  ssl_bump terminate step2

  # decrypt with server-cert forging
  ssl_bump bump step3


That peek at step1 allows Squid can splice if things to badly at the 
step2 staring. A peek at step1 will not prevent a step3 bump.

And the explicit line with 'bump' ensures that Squid actually does a 
bump, the default behaviour is a little bit too variable depending on 
what bugs are present in the SSL-Bump code.
