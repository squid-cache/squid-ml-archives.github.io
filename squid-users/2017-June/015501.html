That is the hack workaround doing its thing. Squid is authenticating the 
CONNECT message, then simply reporting that authenticated username for 
all the bumped <A HREF="https://">https://</A> log entries. In its current form/code it sort-of 
works most of the time, but can break (start rejecting everything) if 
there is ever even a slightest wobble in the credentials validity while 
the bump of that tunnel is ongoing.


&gt;<i> 2)........ we have a dns server (192.168.1.222) that just have our internal
</I>&gt;<i> dns names and then points to 8.8.8.8... that (192.168.1.222) dns server
</I>&gt;<i> would it not be useful either?
</I>
The core issue is the speed at which that service rotates its response 
IP lists, which is directly related to each request going to entirely 
different server in their farm. Simply having a single (and maybe more 
sane regarding TTLs) resolver as a networks focal point for the traffic 
before it reaches out to the Google service seems to bring sanity back 
to the performance.
