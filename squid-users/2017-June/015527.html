&gt;<i> Hi. For what I understood. It is important ttl of dns names.

Yes, TTL is important.  It tells caching DNS servers how long they may 
remember the last answer they got from the authoritative server, before they 
need to ask the authoritative server again.

&gt;<i> So, I wanted to know when the squid server would ask for resolution again.
</I>
Well, that's a different question.

Q: When will Squid ask [its configured name server] for resolution again?
A: When it needs to know the answer again.

Q: When will the [recursive] DNS server which Squid asks, ask for resolution 
again?
A: When the TTL has expired.

&gt;<i> That is, how long was the record kept.
</I>
That is the TTL.

&gt;<i> ;; ANSWER SECTION:
</I>&gt;<i> yahoo.com.		590	IN	A	98.138.253.109
</I>
&gt;<i> ;; ANSWER SECTION:
</I>&gt;<i> pijamasurf.com.		299	IN	A	104.24.25.112
</I>
&gt;<i> I wish I could put a bigger ttl to avoid being asked every &quot;little amount of
</I>&gt;<i> time&quot; by one address.
</I>
Why?  What does it matter to you that Yahoo asks your DNS server to refresh 
its results no more than 30 minutes after the last time (your example of 590 
fails to mention that you clearly asked your local name server for yahoo.com 
1210 seconds previously).  If you want to know the real TTL, ask an 
authoritative name server:

$ dig @ns1.yahoo.com. yahoo.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
yahoo.com.              1800    IN      A       98.139.183.24

If you only ask your local caching server, all you are finding out is how much 
longer its cached answer is valid for, before it will ask (the authoritative 
servers) again.

&gt;<i> For example pijamasurf.com = 299 and yahoo = 590, so
</I>&gt;<i> who manage that time??
</I>
Whoever maintains the zone files (DNS records) for those domains.

&gt;<i> how can i put more time to live?
</I>
You cannot (and should not).

&gt;<i> Or does this make no sense?
</I>
Why do you want to change the TTL on somebody else's domain?

What (do you think) is the benefit for you?

&gt;<i> Maybe I did not understand Amos's comment.
</I>
Please repeat the comment which led you to trying to change the TTL of other 
people's domains - maybe that will help us better understand what you are 
trying to achieve,


Antony.
