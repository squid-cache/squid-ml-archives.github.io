No, the Vary header does not say Cookie is part of the variance AFAICT. 
Just URL plus Accept-Encoding.

The Cookie/Set-Cookie being accurate is just related to whether the 
client browsing session is kept continuous or breaks. Depending on 
whether this transaction is part of a purchase or something similar that 
may be significant, or not.

At a guess since this is a media related object from Apple I suspect it 
is linked to an iTunes account of some sort. So the Cookie might be 
needed by the client for something. In that case getting a reply without 
one (as a pure cache HIT would appear to the client) may have problems.

That is just speculation though to show that this traffic behaviour is 
not completely unreasonable. Only the site and client software authors 
actually know for sure what is intended to be going on and why.


So, to get back on topic. Yes Squid should be caching it. But don't 
expect to see the letters &quot;HIT&quot; in the log anymore for this particular URL.
