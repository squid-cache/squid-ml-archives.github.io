<PRE>Thanks for your reply, Amos.

What exactly is the &quot;it&quot; that you're saying is prohibited by the OS kernel?
Source spoofing alone, or something else?

Also, HTTP contains multiplexing and persistent connections. So there is no
&gt;<i> particular relation between one incoming/client connection and the
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing/server connection(s) the traffic from that client goes out on.
</I>&gt;<i> Added to that, a client request may generate multiple outgoing requests of
</I>&gt;<i> various types, or Squid may itself generate traffic for its own needs
</I>&gt;<i> without any client interaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So doing this just degrades the proxy performance. And not in a small way
</I>&gt;<i> - intercepted traffic pinning everything as this would need comes out about
</I>&gt;<i> 10% nominal (90% reduction), and at the extreme end proxies with NTLM going
</I>&gt;<i> through to an origin see only 1% of nominal performance. Nominal for me
</I>&gt;<i> being what I clocked a big clients network doing in real-world traffic a
</I>&gt;<i> few years back: ~20000 requests per second a few years back (Squid Project
</I>&gt;<i> got approx 2x that in controlled lab tests).
</I>

Good to know there are strong performance implications, thanks. I don't
understand these systems deeply enough to have anticipated this, so I
appreciate the heads-up. Too many systems to learn, too quickly...

I got the nearly-equivalent functionality working for reverse proxying
&gt;&gt;<i> using nginx, but so far I've found no way to do it with forward proxying.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nginx doesn't do https forward proxying (no handling of CONNECT).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So Nginx can be used to attack networks from inside. Good no know we now
</I>&gt;<i> have to watch out for that in viral payloads too.
</I>

&quot;Can be used to attack&quot; because of source spoofing, or something else?

If squid can't do what I'm looking for today, I would welcome pointers to
&gt;&gt;<i> other possible approaches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Squid supports X-Forwarded-For fully - it was invented by Squid devs back
</I>&gt;<i> in the day, and Squid is still the authoritative implementation for how it
</I>&gt;<i> is supposed to work. As an old feature just about all other HTTP server and
</I>&gt;<i> intermediary software have support for that too so you should have no issue
</I>&gt;<i> pulling the data out at the receiving end, or in HTTP processing DPI
</I>&gt;<i> software / firewalls etc. It is sent on all outgoing Squid messages unless
</I>&gt;<i> you explicitly configure something else to happen with the forwarded_for
</I>&gt;<i> directive.
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/forwarded_for/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/forwarded_for/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll ask the team managing the next-hop device to evaluate that
possibility; it looks to me from the docs like it might work. Thanks for
the suggestion.
