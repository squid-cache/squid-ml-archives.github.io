Er, what?

Why are you specifying port 21 as SSL?

Surely the option merely tells Squid whether to allow active or passive FTP 
connections - it doesn't tell the client application what to ask for.

&quot;ftp_passive off&quot; should mean that you can't do passive FTP through the Squid 
server, but it won't stop the client application from trying.

You need to tell the client system/s always to use active FTP (which will go 
through Squid) - Squid can't do that for you - it will simply allow or block 
whatever requests come its way.

-- 
Under UK law, no VAT is charged on biscuits and cakes - they are &quot;zero rated&quot;.  
Chocolate covered biscuits, however, are classed as &quot;luxury items&quot; and are 
subject to VAT.  McVitie's classed its Jaffa Cakes as cakes, but in 1991 this 
was challenged by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise in court.

The question which had to be answered was what criteria should be used to 
class something as a cake or a biscuit.  McVitie's defended the classification 
of Jaffa Cakes as a cake by arguing that cakes go hard when stale, whereas 
biscuits go soft.  It was demonstrated that Jaffa Cakes become hard when stale 
and McVitie's won the case.
