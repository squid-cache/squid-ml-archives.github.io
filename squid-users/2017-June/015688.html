<PRE>Hey Nishant,

Responding to your idea and the whole concept of the helper and also comparing to GoLang binaries.

About the software design to run on-top of embedded hardware and a GoLang binary:
A GoLang helper can be compiled to almost any modern embedded device(else them mips based)
Also its more efficient then any software you will write with perl.
The only &quot;limit&quot; is CPU comparability and Binary size vs device free space.(in any case a perl helper would use more then a GoLang one).

The idea of writing a software that will implement concurrency in perl or python is nice and noble but I believe that probably
for small embedded devices you won't need a &quot;robust&quot; helper that supports concurrency or any other more complex solutions.

I believe that you should aim for the more standard hardware devices which squid can be built on-top such as:
- x86
- x86_64
- arm64
- arm5
- arm8

The above will benefit from a good and robust helper which supports concurrency.
Now that it's clear that your socket can handle more then only one request I will write a helper in GoLang that works with:
- concurrency
- better connection handling(being able to handle responses whenever they received)

I already wrote most of the code so I believe it's a matter of days for the helper to be ready.
Would I be able to receive some testing api key\token once the helper will be ready?

Thanks,
Eliezer

Re-reading my mail made me realise that it conveyed that helper architecture of squid be modified,  instead I wanted to say that we can modify the architecture of our helper, where it internally manages its own children which may speed-up the URL rewrite process.

&gt;<i>The URL-rewrite API being used by charcoal has the purpose of altering

</I>
I agree, external ACL helper will also allow to have access to  additional information like user-agent, reply content-type etc. to have more granular control.

Nishant
