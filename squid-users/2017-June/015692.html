</I>
To clarify that. This Squid is missing the --with-openssl build option, 
which is required both by OpenSSL and any library derived from it.

see &quot;squid -v&quot; for the details of a specific squid binary. This will now 
distinguish between the OpenSSL vs LibreSSL vs other situation.


&gt;<i> Moreover:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Squid does not know anything about LibreSSL. Somebody added the
</I>&gt;<i> letters &quot;LibreSSL&quot; to squid.conf.documented, but that was a mistake IMO.
</I>
The mentions of LibreSSL in the current file are for things which were 
tested before the recent round of LibreSSL issues. Specifically loading 
CA certs from a file. AFAIK that should still be working.

ssl-bump is correctly not one of those options mentioning it. Also, note 
that the fatal error message does not mention any particular library. It 
is about lack of support from *any* library in the current build.

</I>&gt;<i> if (and only if) LibreSSL does a good job providing that OpenSSL API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * LibreSSL does not do a good job providing OpenSSL API and/or Squid
</I>&gt;<i> does not do a good job detecting OpenSSL API variations in a
</I>&gt;<i> LibreSSL-compatible way (depending on your point of view). See bug #4662
</I>&gt;<i> for more details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There have been recent improvements in LibreSSL-compatibility area, but
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure those improvements (or the problems) are in your Squid
</I>&gt;<i> version and,
</I>
They are. Though the release notes still say &quot;This release does not 
support LibreSSL&quot; at present since we have had no positive feedback on 
anything actually working yet.


&gt;<i> at any rate, are taking significant additional risks by
</I>&gt;<i> using LibreSSL with SslBump. Whether those risks are worth using
</I>&gt;<i> something other than OpenSSL is your call, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Since the risk here is due to lack of testing... More testing is very 
welcome of course. Especially with feedback about what works and what 
does not.
