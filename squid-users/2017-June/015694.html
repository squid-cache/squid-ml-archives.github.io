<PRE>Hello,

I was referring to:
<A HREF="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice#Actions">http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice#Actions</A>

Based on explanation I wonder if peek and stare are exactly same at step 1?

If yes, which one should I use at step 1? peek or stare?

I am asking because in future their function may change (at step 1).

My intention is to bump as much traffic as can be done. (at step 3)

Currently:
At step 1 I peek most traffic (and splice traffic originating from some IPs)
At step 2 I stare most traffic (and splice exempted domains)
At step 3 everything is bumped.

If peek and stare are same at step 1, I may change peek to stare so that 
it looks consistent.


My 2nd question is:

In the above link it is mentioned under &quot;Configuration Examples&quot; that:
&quot;At no point during ssl_bump processing will dstdomain ACL work. That 
ACL relies on HTTP message details that are not yet decrypted&quot;

Does it hold true for dstdom_regex as well? Because both seem to apply 
to same thing.

Thanks and regards,

Amish.
