IMO, regardless of whether LibreSSL works for loading CA certs from a
file, it is a mistake for Squid documentation to potentially imply,
however indirectly, that Squid supports LibreSSL today. Besides, I do
not think that loading CA is somehow meaningful in isolation from 100
other actions participating in TLS traffic processing.

It may be possible to meaningfully divide TLS-related code into SslBump
and everything else, but Squid offers proper LibreSSL support for
neither SslBump nor &quot;everything else&quot; IMO.

Please do not remove that &quot;does not support&quot; disclaimer even if somebody
says that they are using LibreSSL successfully.

&gt;<i> Since the risk here is due to lack of testing... More testing is very

</I>
I disagree. The Project should not welcome more bug reports about an
unsupported library unless we want to spend our cycles on actually
supporting that library. IMHO, we must spend those cycles on other, more
important/higher priority things.

Alex.
