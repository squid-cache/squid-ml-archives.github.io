FWIW, Connection and possibly some &quot;etc.&quot; headers are hop-by-hop headers
so if a blocking site really pays attention to them, it should be told
to exclude them.

</I>
The answer depends on whether you want to:

A) prevent pointless edits (difficult and less effective but has a
fighting chance of official acceptance because it is a useful
performance optimization) or

B) simply reorder all the fields just before sending them, based on a
User-Agent field-driven order table (easy to hack in and effective but
less likely to be officially accepted due to performance overheads and
configuration/support complexities).

If you want a general vague answer, search for calls to non-const
HttpHeader methods like HttpHeader::delByName() and
HttpHeader::insertEntry(). There are about 20-30 potentially relevant
methods AFAICT. And examine the sending code in
HttpStateData::httpBuildRequestHeader().


Please note that the discussion about Squid code belongs to squid-dev,
not squid-users.


HTH,

Alex.

</I>&gt;<i>     like mindless &quot;reordering&quot; to the outside observer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The two actions (field deletion and addition) may happen in a single

</I>&gt;<i>     Preventing pointless editing in the former cases is straightforward, but
</I>&gt;<i>     the latter cases are difficult to handle. Correct avoidance of pointless
</I>&gt;<i>     editing may improve performance and, if it does, can be considered a
</I>&gt;<i>     useful optimization on its own, regardless of your use case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Is there any way to prevent this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Not without changing Squid code (or adding more proxies). However,
</I>&gt;<i>     before we even talk about code changes, we should clarify the problem we
</I>&gt;<i>     are dealing with. The questions below will guide you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It is probably much easier to ensure some fixed field send order
</I>&gt;<i>     (regardless of the received order) than to preserve the received order.
</I>&gt;<i>     Will a fixed order (e.g., always alphabetical) address your use case?
</I>&gt;<i>     This feature will hurt performance, but you might be able to convince
</I>&gt;<i>     others to accept it if you have a very compelling/specific/detailed use
</I>&gt;<i>     case because it can be disabled by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; I am asking because some sites detect bots using the header order and
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; they drop any such connection. So they unintentionally block squid
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; proxies even if its not being used by a bot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Are you implying that bots often change header field order between their
</I>&gt;<i>     requests? Or that bots often use a different (fixed) header field order
</I>&gt;<i>     than the (fixed) field order used by non-bots? Preserving received order
</I>&gt;<i>     may help in the former case but not in the latter case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Also, do those blocking sites pay attention to all headers or just
</I>&gt;<i>     end-to-end headers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Please note that there are many other ways to detect a proxy so if a
</I>&gt;<i>     site wants to block proxies rather than bots, then it is probably
</I>&gt;<i>     pointless to fight it (or, at least, the Squid Project should not).
</I>&gt;<i>
