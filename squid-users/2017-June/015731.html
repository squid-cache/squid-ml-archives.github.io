HTTP is a stateless protocol. There is no session concept at the level 
Squid operates. That is a purely web-application-layer thing in the browser.

A browser being shutdown and re-opened is indistinguishable to Squid 
from a browser simply opening a new TCP connection. Which happens 
routinely without the browser being shutdown anyway, since browsers use 
8+ (up to several hundred) of TCP connections in parallel.

So while there is a &quot;first&quot; authentication (as in &quot;first ever&quot; or &quot;first 
since N minutes ago&quot;), there is no &quot;last&quot;.



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is there anything in log format help me view that action in cache.log ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you recommend other external helpers for that ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
To get the details you ask for, look at what the helper can report in 
its debug output, or adding a wrapper script around it that does the 
logging you want.

BUT, it should be clear from the info I gave above that what you seek is 
simply not going to be visible in any information Squid or its helper 
can log.
  What the access.log entry is saying is just &quot;this request had 
credentials for X, they were checked and valid when this transaction 
started.&quot;. Nothing about any session thing.
