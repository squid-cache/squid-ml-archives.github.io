<PRE>Hi All


We recently installed Squid 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.3 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS on two
machines.     Squid works fine on the first machine.   But on the second
machine, Squid is able to start successfully but is not listening to any
port at all.   Not the default 3128 or any other port we configure in
squid.conf.   We disabled the iptables firewall and it didn't help.    Then
we read the link below and were able to get Squid to listen to 3218 by
setting pinger_enable to off in squid.conf.

However, we don't want to have to set pinger_enable to off (the default is
on).   And the link below doesn't explain how to get pinger to work.
 There isn't any information in the logs.   We are planning to reinstall
the OS and then try again.    But does anybody here knows how to get Squid
to work with pinger_enable set to on (default)?

Thank you very much in anticipation
