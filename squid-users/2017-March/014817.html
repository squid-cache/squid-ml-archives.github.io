<PRE>Hey Gui,

The right way to allow pinger to work is to use the setuid bit ie:
$ chwon root.root /pinger_path/pinger
$ chmod +s /pinger_path/pinger

This will allow pinger to start as a root use by any of the machine users and in this case squid.
There might be another restriction by the OS but I am not sure since I am using my own packge for Ubuntu for now.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Subject: [squid-users] Why do we have to set pinger_enable to off to get Squid to work

Hi All



We recently installed Squid 3.5.12-1ubuntu7.3 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS on two machines.     Squid works fine on the first machine.   But on the second machine, Squid is able to start successfully but is not listening to any port at all.   Not the default 3128 or any other port we configure in squid.conf.   We disabled the iptables firewall and it didn't help.    Then we read the link below and were able to get Squid to listen to 3218 by setting pinger_enable to off in squid.conf.

However, we don't want to have to set pinger_enable to off (the default is on).   And the link below doesn't explain how to get pinger to work.    There isn't any information in the logs.   We are planning to reinstall the OS and then try again.    But does anybody here knows how to get Squid to work with pinger_enable set to on (default)?

Thank you very much in anticipation

Gui
