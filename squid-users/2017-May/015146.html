<PRE>I wanted to set up a proxy on my home server for use from remote locations to use as a web proxy (of course) and also to run SSH over. &#160;This means that basic auth is undesirable due to the login being sent in clear text. &#160;So, someone suggested digest auth, and I was happy. &#160;But, now I'm finding that PuTTY and WinSCP do not support digest auth. &#160;And consequently, I haven't found any other SSH clients that support digest. (sigh)
So, I'm back to plan b, and that is to have a secure proxy connection so all browser-to-server communication is encrypted. &#160;Since SSH over proxy might not be feasible because I don't want to use basic auth, I could use shellinabox if the proxy link is secure. &#160;So the question is, does anyone know if squid 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 supports secure connections? &#160;From what I've found it does not, although nothing has definitively said one way or another. &#160;Is there a way to tell? &#160;I've tried configuring for it and it didn't work, but I have little confidence in my config file for this.
