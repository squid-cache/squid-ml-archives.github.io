The &quot;ssh&quot; part is unrelated to Squid. Secure ssh separately from Squid.

These problems will go away if you stop mixing Squid and ssh. Squid is
HTTP while PuTTY/WinSCP is SSH. You gain very little by trying to use
the same authentication mechanism for both protocols in your use case.


&gt;<i> So, I'm back to plan b, and that is to have a secure proxy connection so

</I>
That is a good idea if all of your browsers support it. Popular browsers
support HTTPS-to-proxy on desktop, but I am not sure about their mobile
versions. You may have to jump through some hoops.


&gt;<i> So the question is, does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know if squid 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 supports secure connections?
</I>
Squid v3.5 supports secure connections to the proxy. See &quot;TLS / SSL
Options&quot; for the http_port directive (not the https_port directive!).

You can install Squid v3.5 on Ubuntu. I do not know whether the official
Ubuntu Squid package is built with the required support.


HTH,

Alex.
