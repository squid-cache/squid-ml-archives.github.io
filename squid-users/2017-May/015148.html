<PRE>I should clarify things a bit. &#160;I do realize SSH and squid are separate, but the problem I'm having is I cannot SSH into my home server from an organization that is apparently blocking SSH connections, for whatever reason, intentional or not. &#160;I am, however, able to use a squid proxy that I run from my home server. &#160;So the plan was to use SSH through the proxy. &#160;VPNs are out of the question as this does not work.
I would only need to use my proxy from the desktop, so mobile is not required. &#160;

&gt;<i>Squid v3.5 supports secure connections to the proxy. See &quot;TLS / SSL
</I>&gt;<i>Options&quot; for the http_port directive (not the https_port directive!).
</I>
This is helpful since I was trying to use https_port.

The &quot;ssh&quot; part is unrelated to Squid. Secure ssh separately from Squid.


&gt;<i> This means that basic auth is undesirable due to the login being sent

</I>
These problems will go away if you stop mixing Squid and ssh. Squid is
HTTP while PuTTY/WinSCP is SSH. You gain very little by trying to use
the same authentication mechanism for both protocols in your use case.


&gt;<i> So, I'm back to plan b, and that is to have a secure proxy connection so

</I>
That is a good idea if all of your browsers support it. Popular browsers
support HTTPS-to-proxy on desktop, but I am not sure about their mobile
versions. You may have to jump through some hoops.


&gt;<i> So the question is, does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know if squid 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 supports secure connections?
</I>
Squid v3.5 supports secure connections to the proxy. See &quot;TLS / SSL
Options&quot; for the http_port directive (not the https_port directive!).

You can install Squid v3.5 on Ubuntu. I do not know whether the official
Ubuntu Squid package is built with the required support.


HTH,

Alex.
