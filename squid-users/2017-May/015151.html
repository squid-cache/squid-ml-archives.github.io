I think what you're saying is it's a port number issue, that certain ports are problematic. &#160;But that doesn't seem to be the case. &#160;I already run SSH on a non-standard port, and have tried moving SSH to squid's port after moving moving squid elsewhere; it still doesn't work. &#160;In addition, I'm able to connect to an entirely different service I run on the same server. &#160;So it seems SSH is being filtered
