It is impossible. The TLS client decides which certificates are pinned
to which servers. Squid cannot know that because the client commitment
to pin is not expressed in the TLS protocol.

Said that, please do pay attention to Yuri's response quoted below. Yuri
has identified your immediate problem, which is _not_ pinning.

Alex.
