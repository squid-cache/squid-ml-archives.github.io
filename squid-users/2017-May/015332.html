Two things to take note of with these reports.

First is the queue length vs how many helpers are running. Each helper 
running has one row in the table. Your initial report with 20 helpers 
had no queue, and showed that all 20 helpers had been needed at one 
point, but the top-5 only needed a few times.
  IMO that is not overkill, but close to what you actually need. In a 
perfect world there should be some helpers not needed at all, but peak 
traffic does happen.

Second thing to notice is the &quot;avg service time&quot;. In that same initial 
report it showed avg was 9ms - that is good (might be better if you tune 
the auth backend for speed, but a few ms is okay). These later reports 
when you were experimenting it fluctuates between 300ms and 850ms. That 
can be kind of bad - if it remains high with just normal traffic that is 
something to fix. That said it may have been an artifact from the delay 
caused by reconfiguring and restarting all the helpers, which is 
supported by the low number of requests processed by the heaviest used 
helper (~500).
