So, do you have two Squid instances, or three, in total?

Yes, you could, provided it has an appropriate configuration.

&gt;<i> It would be better?? it give some benefits??
</I>
Why not just try it and see (by whatever measurement you use to judge 
&quot;better&quot;)?

After all, adding a neighbour peer is only a configuration change on the Squid 
server - clients don't even know about it, so it's simple to do (and undo).

I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way 
is to make it so simple that there are _obviously_ no deficiencies, and the 
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no _obvious_ 
deficiencies.
