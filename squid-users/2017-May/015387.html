You configure the one the clients point to for SSO (I'm assuming that is your 
&quot;working / production&quot; server), and you simply configure the other to accept 
peer requests from the first - it will never get client requests directly.

1. Don't use Squid - just let your clients access the Internet directly.

2. If you do use Squid, use as simple a configuration as possible, and make 
sure that Squid runs as efficiently as possible on the hardware you have (ie: 
don't use VMs; don't run multiple instances on one machine; don't run other 
CPU or disk -intensive processes on the same machine).

3. For only 110 clients, unless your hardware is remarkably old and low-
performance, just use a single proxy server.
