<PRE>Thanks for the clarification.
I went back to the squid.conf I was using successfully (without encryption) and changed http_port to https_port and added the cert and key you mentioned. &#160;Since I'm not all that knowledgeable about SSL certs, I had some trouble with squid not liking the keys I provided. &#160;So I eventually found this command to generate what I need:
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -keyout /etc/squid/squid.pem -out /etc/squid/squid.pem -days 365 -nodes

which puts them into the same file, which squid seemed to be ok with.
Then I tried starting another instance of Chrome using:
chrome --proxy-server=<A HREF="https://my-domain-name:8092">https://my-domain-name:8092</A>

but it didn't work. &#160;No errors, nothing unusual. &#160;Chrome simply behaved like there was no proxy configured. &#160;I found documentation on chromium.org that showed the format as:
chrome --proxy-server=&quot;<A HREF="https://my-domain-name:8092">https://my-domain-name:8092</A>&quot;

so I tried adding the quotes, but no change.
I then removed the private key from squid.pem and saved it as another file on the Windows computer running Chrome, and added it as a cert. &#160;No problem there, but no change.
My squid.conf is below. &#160;I'm at a loss as far as what to try next.

</I>

Some people seem to be calling it &quot;HTTPS&quot;, but that is not correct and 
thankfully makes it difficult to find the bad info. (that said our own 
wiki documents it on the HTTPS page referenced below :-P ).

The current IETF term for it is &quot;TLS explicit proxy&quot;. Previously it did 
not have a formal term and often got described in words like &quot;TLS proxy&quot; 
or sometimes &quot;TLS to the proxy&quot; and variants switching &quot;SSL&quot; for &quot;TLS&quot;. 
It also has some relation to early forms of &quot;HTTP opportunistic 
security&quot; - though that now means an HTTP version of emails STARTTLS 
that is quite unrelated to anything Squid supports at present.



&gt;<i> And secondly, any advice on the error?&#160; Or even better, a good 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial on setting this up?&#160; I thought if I follow a configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly, I'd be off and running with little problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The ssl_crtd helper in not related to TLS explicit proxy. It is a part 
of SSL-Bump features for intercepting HTTPS traffic, specifically it is 
the part that forges certificates.

You could avoid it entirely by removing the --enable-ssl-crtd build 
option if you don't need SSL-Bump features later. Otherwise check the 
directory creation and ownership permissions are correct and that Squid 
http_port is *not* setup to use ssl-bump features (yet).


The TLS explicit proxy is simply a Squid that uses https_port to receive 
proxy traffic, as opposed to http_port. You will need a server 
certificate for that, but nothing else special on Squid's side of 
things. eg:
&#160; https_port 3128 cert=blah_public.pem key=blah_private.key

The tricky part is getting a browser to talk TLS to anything other than 
origin servers.&#160; The details we know of are all at
