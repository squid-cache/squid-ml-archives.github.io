Two reasons;

1) &quot;HTTPS&quot; has a definition (HTTP messages over TLS transport) and a 
scheme (<A HREF="https://">https://</A>) which explicitly precludes it being used to contact 
forward proxies. TLS to a proxy does not have a scheme of its own and 
can carry any protocol the proxy supports, not just HTTP.

2) protocol nesting for HTTPS-over-HTTPS is a very different series of 
layers and message sequence(s) than HTTPS-over-TLS [to a proxy]. In 
particular it is 4 layers deep (one for each &quot;HTTPS&quot;).

Both HTTPS and TLS can be used independently to connect to a proxy. The 
differences are discussed at some length in the drafts below [a][b], its 
technically a fine line but the privacy and security implications are 
huge. People talking about one protocol stack while using the terms from 
the other have led to a lot of deadlocked arguments already.

</I>
No direct reference sorry - it is not formal and may change, thus 
&quot;current&quot;. It is what the sub-group of the WG have been using to discuss 
the case of &quot;TLS (explicit)&quot; connections made to an explicit proxy (see 
that 4-word -&gt; 3-word redux?) since the long discussions instigated by 
the loreto draft[a] has effectively burned the term &quot;trusted proxy&quot; and 
&quot;HTTPS proxy&quot; into being HTTPS protocol stack to a proxy, and the rpeon 
draft[b] has formalized the term &quot;explicit proxy&quot; as what used to be the 
defacto standard &quot;forward-proxy&quot; with again &quot;trusted proxy&quot; being full 
decryption at the proxy.
