<PRE>Some more info: &#160;I tried this on Firefox 53 and got more feedback, but still doesn't work. &#160;Per the recommendation on bugzilla (bug 378637), I put <A HREF="https://myaddress:myport&#160;into">https://myaddress:myport&#160;into</A> firefox and it gives me a &quot;Your connection is not secure&quot;. &#160;So I add the exception, and it then displays the squid message &quot;ERROR The requested URL could not be retrieved&quot;, as expected.
So I add the proxy to Firefox (in Advanced, Network, Settings) as the HTTP Proxy....doesn't work, &quot;The proxy server is refusing connections&quot;. &#160;I then put <A HREF="https://">https://</A> in front of the address, then it's &quot;Server not found&quot;. &#160;I then add it as SSL Proxy. &#160;It appears to be working, but really it's simply not using the proxy at all because I stopped squid and it made no difference.
The link you reference on getting Firefox to work with this refers to Firefox 33, so by now I'd think I could directly add the proxy to the normal place in Firefox options?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Some people seem to be calling it &quot;HTTPS&quot;, but that is not correct and 
thankfully makes it difficult to find the bad info. (that said our own 
wiki documents it on the HTTPS page referenced below :-P ).

The current IETF term for it is &quot;TLS explicit proxy&quot;. Previously it did 
not have a formal term and often got described in words like &quot;TLS proxy&quot; 
or sometimes &quot;TLS to the proxy&quot; and variants switching &quot;SSL&quot; for &quot;TLS&quot;. 
It also has some relation to early forms of &quot;HTTP opportunistic 
security&quot; - though that now means an HTTP version of emails STARTTLS 
that is quite unrelated to anything Squid supports at present.



&gt;<i> And secondly, any advice on the error?&#160; Or even better, a good 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial on setting this up?&#160; I thought if I follow a configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly, I'd be off and running with little problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The ssl_crtd helper in not related to TLS explicit proxy. It is a part 
of SSL-Bump features for intercepting HTTPS traffic, specifically it is 
the part that forges certificates.

You could avoid it entirely by removing the --enable-ssl-crtd build 
option if you don't need SSL-Bump features later. Otherwise check the 
directory creation and ownership permissions are correct and that Squid 
http_port is *not* setup to use ssl-bump features (yet).


The TLS explicit proxy is simply a Squid that uses https_port to receive 
proxy traffic, as opposed to http_port. You will need a server 
certificate for that, but nothing else special on Squid's side of 
things. eg:
&#160; https_port 3128 cert=blah_public.pem key=blah_private.key

The tricky part is getting a browser to talk TLS to anything other than 
origin servers.&#160; The details we know of are all at
