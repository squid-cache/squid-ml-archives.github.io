... which is exactly what we are discussing: A browser sending HTTP
messages to the proxy, over TLS.


&gt;<i> and a scheme (<A HREF="https://">https://</A>) which explicitly precludes it being used to contact
</I>&gt;<i> forward proxies. 
</I>
FWIW, Curl and some other clients use https scheme to configure HTTPS
proxies. Perhaps they are violating some IETF prohibition, but I doubt
that they actually do.


&gt;<i> TLS to a proxy does not have a scheme of its own and
</I>&gt;<i> can carry any protocol the proxy supports, not just HTTP.
</I>
Very true and emphasizes why &quot;TLS proxy&quot; does not define much and,
hence, is not a very useful term.


&gt;<i> 2) protocol nesting for HTTPS-over-HTTPS is a very different series of
</I>&gt;<i> layers and message sequence(s) than HTTPS-over-TLS [to a proxy]. In
</I>&gt;<i> particular it is 4 layers deep (one for each &quot;HTTPS&quot;).
</I>
Yes, but I do not see the relevance. &quot;HTTPS proxy&quot; does not say what is
going on inside the CONNECT tunnels (if any). Yes, supporting HTTPS
proxies/&quot;TLS explicit proxies&quot; in the real world is difficult because
getting HTTPS-over-HTTPS to work is difficult, but what does that have
to do with the terminology?


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The current IETF term for it is &quot;TLS explicit proxy&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any supporting references?
</I>
&gt;<i> No direct reference sorry - it is not formal and may change
</I>
Or it may not be a result of any IETF consensus. Or it may not even exist!


&gt;<i> [a] <A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-loreto-httpbis-trusted-proxy20/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-loreto-httpbis-trusted-proxy20/</A>
</I>
Uses the terms &quot;explicit proxy&quot; and &quot;trusted proxy&quot; not &quot;TLS explicit
proxy&quot;.


&gt;<i> [b] <A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-rpeon-httpbis-exproxy-01">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-rpeon-httpbis-exproxy-01</A>
</I>
Uses the terms &quot;configured-proxy&quot; and &quot;trusted-proxy&quot; not &quot;TLS explicit
proxy&quot;.

The &quot;explicit&quot; and &quot;trusted&quot; parts are not the problem, of course. It is
the absence of the HTTP part that is a problem IMO when we are trying to
describe a thing that expects [encrypted] HTTP requests.

Alex.
