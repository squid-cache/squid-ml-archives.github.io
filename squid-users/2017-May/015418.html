The settings you enter via the Browser GUI are exclusively for setting 
up plain-text proxy connections.

&quot;SSL Proxy&quot; in the Browser GUI means the proxy to send any SSL/TLS 
traffic *through* (using CONNECT tunnel).


&gt;<i> The link you reference on getting Firefox to work with this refers to 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox 33, so by now I'd think I could directly add the proxy to the 
</I>&gt;<i> normal place in Firefox options?
</I>
Unfortunately that would be far too sensible.  It only took ~20 years to 
get them to accept any kind of TLS/SSL security on the Browser&lt;-&gt;proxy 
connection in the first place.

I really wish that was a joke, but I've long ago given up on expecting 
sanity from Browser people. For the topic in question, the argument 
behind not adding a simple tick-box to that somewhat hidden GUI popup to 
enable TLS/SSL to a proxy ... is unwaveringly that &quot;changing the UI 
would cause a lot of end users some confusion and pain&quot; or words to that 
affect - and yet I've lost count of how many graphical redesigns have 
happened to the things those end-users are directly seeing and using on 
a daily basis. But one semi-hidden tick box, oh no!
