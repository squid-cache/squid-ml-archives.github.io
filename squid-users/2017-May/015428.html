<PRE>Thought I'd try getting this to work in Chrome too.&#160; NOTHING I try makes it work in Chrome.&#160; Isn't running this from the Windows command line supposed to work?
chrome --proxy-server=<A HREF="https://mydomain:myport">https://mydomain:myport</A>
When I do this, it runs Chrome, but it's still not going through the proxy despite Firefox on the same computer working just fine!

The settings you enter via the Browser GUI are exclusively for setting 
up plain-text proxy connections.

&quot;SSL Proxy&quot; in the Browser GUI means the proxy to send any SSL/TLS 
traffic *through* (using CONNECT tunnel).


&gt;<i> The link you reference on getting Firefox to work with this refers to 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox 33, so by now I'd think I could directly add the proxy to the 
</I>&gt;<i> normal place in Firefox options?
</I>
Unfortunately that would be far too sensible.&#160; It only took ~20 years to 
get them to accept any kind of TLS/SSL security on the Browser&lt;-&gt;proxy 
connection in the first place.

I really wish that was a joke, but I've long ago given up on expecting 
sanity from Browser people. For the topic in question, the argument 
behind not adding a simple tick-box to that somewhat hidden GUI popup to 
enable TLS/SSL to a proxy ... is unwaveringly that &quot;changing the UI 
would cause a lot of end users some confusion and pain&quot; or words to that 
affect - and yet I've lost count of how many graphical redesigns have 
happened to the things those end-users are directly seeing and using on 
a daily basis. But one semi-hidden tick box, oh no!
