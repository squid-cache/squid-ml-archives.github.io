Nobody (certainly not me) has suggested anything that requires studying
Squid source code. If you think that I have, you have misinterpreted
what I have said.

</I>
I recommend triaging this using a Squid instance isolated from all other
traffic. You are making both your job and the job of those who are
trying to help you more difficult by trying to save a few minutes/hours
that are usually required to set up an isolated test.


&gt;<i> Anyway, as a workaround I'm willing to splice/tunnel traffic to
</I>&gt;<i> accounts.google.com *ONLY*, and bump everything else (although I'd
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to understand why bumping isn't &quot;working&quot; for this site).
</I>
&gt;<i> I've tried this:
</I>
&gt;<i> acl GoogleAccounts ssl::server_name accounts.google.com
</I>&gt;<i> acl step1 at_step SslBump1
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump peek step1
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump splice GoogleAccounts
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump bump all
</I>
&gt;<i> However, traffic to accounts.google.com is not spliced, it's bumped
</I>&gt;<i> like the rest.
</I>
You need to figure out why. Two common reasons are SSL-level errors and
http_access denials. Both should be reflected in access.log and
debugging cache.log.


&gt;<i> Can FQDNs be used in ACLs as in the example above even when peeking at step 1?
</I>
Yes. They may not work, but they can be used. They should work if the
request contains TLS SNI. Modern browser requests usually do, but you
can confirm by studying browser-Squid traffic with a tool like Wireshark.


&gt;<i> If I peek at step 2 then I won't be able to &quot;bump all&quot;
</I>
Correct.


&gt;<i> Likewise, If I need to stare at step 2 then I'll never be able to splice
</I>
Correct.


Alex.
