 From 3.5.19 onwards ..

3.5.21 added support for Squid to differentiate between revalidation 
checks that were always vs sometimes necessary. Fixing the situation 
where responses had both a CC:private or CC:no-cache header and 
information stating cacheability &quot;freshness&quot;.

3.5.22 fixed issues that were then seen with missing Last-Modified and 
old Date values, and the Collapsed Forwarding feature.

3.5.23 added support for caching objects with &quot;Vary: *&quot; which depended 
on the change in .21, and caching of 3034 responses. Also fixed the main 
outstanding issue behind Host verify MISS happening, and a regression in 
the .22 collapsed forwarding change.

3.5.24 fixed a regression in the &quot;cache deny&quot; access control handling 
which was causing some thing to be cached and revalidated when they 
should not have. This may make some things now un-cacheable if there is 
a misconfiguration in that directive.

3.5.25 fixed a stall that happens when SSL-Bump interacts with Host 
verification through the SNI value. While not strictly related, having 
it fixed allows a lot more Google/YouTube/Akamai transactions to reach 
the caching stages so their operations start to be visible instead of 
splice/tunnel'ed.


The expected effect of these changes was to fix several major 
unnecessary bandwidth uses;
  - cached YouTube videos starting mid-video when someone else using the 
proxy had only partially watched the same video - causing the user to 
force-refresh and purge the cached video.
  - Chrome and similar Google originated downloads being a MISS for 
identical objects.
  - the often cited terrible HIT reduction on some major hosting 
services (again Google, though also Akamai) traffic since 3.2 Host 
verify was added.
  - collapsed forwarding resulting in large objects being stored to the 
cache then immediately deleted by a parallel fetch.
