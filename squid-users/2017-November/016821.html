<PRE>Hi Team.
We are having squid deployed for users which work well for browsing 
internet. Recently we received complaint from some users who access one of 
the vendor URL to listen audio recordings.
The procedure they follow as
login to Vendor portal URL via squid proxy
select recording option
select recording , it will get downloaded as .wax file
user open .wax file in media player after which they get error message as 
unable to play media.

I checked the .wax file which contains link to media file on their same 
portal URL. but window media player cant access it.

Not sure what is wrong here. I traced squid access logs and able to see 
the request going to vendor portal but still window media player cant play 
this file

Need urgent help if anyone work on this kind of requirement.


Thanks &amp; Regards
Nilesh Suresh Gavali
