What type of URL is it?  HTTP?  HTTPS?  Something else?

&gt;<i> Not sure what is wrong here. I traced squid access logs and able to see
</I>&gt;<i> the request going to vendor portal
</I>
Which request?

The browser request for the .wax file, or the media player request for the 
actual media file?

&gt;<i> but still window media player cant play this file
</I>
It basically sounds as though either:

 -  Windows media player is trying to access a URL directly without going 
through the proxy, or

 - Windows media player is requesting a URL type which Squid can't handle

Tell us what URLs you're seeing in the access log, and what URL is contained 
in the .wax file - that might give us more of a clue.
