Hmm. If you are using SSL-Bump to bump the traffic the current Squid 
should be delivering an ALPN containing only HTTP/1.1 to the server. 
Sending h2 in the ALPN is only valid if the proxy supports h2 natively 
or intends up front to splice the transaction back to &quot;tunneled&quot;.


&gt;<i>

Any info about your Squid version, and squid.conf contents - especially 
http_access and SSL-Bump related things would be useful. Random guesses 
about complex things like TLS are harmful to solving actual problems.
