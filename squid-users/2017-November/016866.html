&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The shutdown time with two sequential calls should be only the time 
</I>&gt;<i> needed to close all the open FD connections, shutdown helpers and 
</I>&gt;<i> release however much memory Squid is using. All that happens in just a 
</I>
&gt;<i> few seconds normally
</I>
I updated to version 3.5.27-20171101-re69e56c, and restarted squid with the double-shutdown trick (I didn't NEED to do it - I just couldn't wait to try it out ;-) ).

The result was acceptable. It didn't take a &quot;few seconds&quot;, but almost 30 seconds. Still, it's a LOT better than before when I had to wait 2 or 3 minutes.

It's fair to say that there weren't as many open FDs as in my previous cases when shutting down Squid was very slow. Now, open FDs were around 7000.
A lot of mem was freed up after the restart.

Making progress.

Thanks,

Vieri
