Yes, definitely mixed up, I meant right but wrote wrong.

&gt;<i> Some services, including many databases, over allocate RAM to store
</I>&gt;<i> rarely used (computed and/or preloaded) data. When that data is swapped
</I>&gt;<i> out, the service often continues to operate normally because the data is

</I>&gt;<i> computing it from scratch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Squid, it is very difficult for the OS to correctly identify the
</I>&gt;<i> rarely used RAM areas to swap out. When the OS swaps out the wrong area,
</I>&gt;<i> Squid slows down (to access that area), which only increases the number
</I>&gt;<i> of concurrent transactions and, hence, the amount of RAM Squid needs to
</I>&gt;<i> operate, which triggers more wrong swap outs, creating a vicious cycle.
</I>
That is why best solution would be swap of. Definitely testing swapoff
next week, if we won't have new problems.

&gt;&gt;<i> Swap could be used  to translate back data to mem if used, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stays on disk and purge after some time if not used ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The purging bit is wrong. Think of swap as very very very slow RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alex.
</I>
So, when squid need something from swap, it will load that data back to ram.
For purge, data then  stay in swap forever ?

Swap very slow ram, best explanation. Use that metaphor during
mentoring younger coworkers :).
Thanks for explaining swap memory problems.
