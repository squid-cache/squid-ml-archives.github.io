It depends on your Squid version.

The latest Squid with annotation support are capable of receiving 
user/group names from the auth and external ACL helpers. These get 
attached to the transaction and can be matched with the 'note' type ACL 
in any later 'fast-category' access controls like delay_pools.

If your Squid is too old to use note ACL, or your helper(s) not 
providing the relevant details to Squid (in Squid-3.4+ helper syntax). 
Then no, sorry.
