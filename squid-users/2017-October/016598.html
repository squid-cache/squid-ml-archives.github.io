Definitely talk to the uBlock people. Maybe the chrome ones as well.

That same debug suggestion I tacked on the end of my last response is 
still relevant. It will give you more info to work with in your 
discussions with them if you can demonstrate what input message is 
getting borked.

NO problem. It's usually interesting to see whats going on in the world.
