Oh, I thought each block had a TLV and checksum bits as well.

This last one was what I was referring to as corruption. Though I expect 
that *removing* slots would lead memory index pointing to no longer 
valid locations in the rock database.

Is it harmless to access out-of-range offsets into a memmap'ed file - 
specifically ones which *were* valid when it was initially mapped?
