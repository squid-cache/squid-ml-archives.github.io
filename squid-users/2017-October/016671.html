There is slot-specific metadata (and associated consistency checks), but
it is designed to work fine with all-zeros (i.e., initial or empty)
slots. Filling a 1TB disk cache with something just to &quot;initialize&quot; it
would be rather wasteful/annoying...

There are no true slot checksums.


&gt;&gt;<i> * Removing a slot, whole or partial, will invalidate the cache entry

&gt;<i> This last one was what I was referring to as corruption. 
</I>
AFAICT, OP has explicitly stated that some loss of cached data is fine
(i.e., it is not considered cache corruption). In the original question,
corruption was defined as &quot;rubbish data delivered to clients&quot;.


&gt;<i> Though I expect
</I>&gt;<i> that *removing* slots would lead memory index pointing to no longer
</I>&gt;<i> valid locations in the rock database.
</I>
The in-memory index is created from the on-disk metadata. Bugs
notwithstanding, if on-disk metadata contains an incomplete entry (e.g.,
an entry slot pointer pointing beyond the current database boundary),
then Rock will not add that entry to the in-memory index, and, hence,
Squid will not know about that entry existence.


&gt;<i> Is it harmless to access out-of-range offsets into a memmap'ed file -
</I>&gt;<i> specifically ones which *were* valid when it was initially mapped?
</I>
Out-of-range accesses are probably deadly, but no such accesses should
be happening due to database size changes. Please note that the question
was about database size changes while Squid &quot;is not running&quot;. When Squid
starts, it creates memory segments and builds its in-memory disk index
there from scratch, ignoring any bad on-disk entries.


HTH,

Alex.
