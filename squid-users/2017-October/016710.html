<PRE>I've seen this before w/google in Opera -- but it doesn't seem
 to happen with IE or Palemoon (both going through my SSL-bumping proxy).
Even my housemate, going through the proxy using Chrome doesn't
get this error (it also uses the system cert location). 

When I bring up the security dialog in Opera, it brings up the same
dialog I see under the Win Control Panel under Internet Settings,
the &quot;Content&quot; tab -- where I see Certificates.  My proxy cert is listed 
under the Trusted Root Cert Authorities.


So why is Opera failing when going to google.com?
Ideas?

Thanks!
Linda




  Your connection is not private

This server could not prove that it is *www.google.com*; its security 
certificate does not specify Subject Alternative Names. This may be 
caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection.

You cannot proceed because the website operator has requested heightened 
security for this domain.

Back to safety


        Help me understand

When you connect to a secure website, the server hosting that site 
presents your browser with something called a &quot;certificate&quot; to verify 
its identity. This certificate contains identity information, such as 
the address of the website, which is verified by a third party that your 
computer trusts. By checking that the address in the certificate matches 
the address of the website, it is possible to verify that you are 
securely communicating with the website you intended, and not a third 
party (such as an attacker on your network).

You cannot visit www.google.com right now because the website uses HSTS. 
Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will 
probably work later.
