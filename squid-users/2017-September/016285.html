Why do you want to set up a *reverse* proxy for Office 365 traffic?

Are you running Office 365 servers and want some sort of front-end for them?

I thought Microsoft ran all the Office 365 servers, and everyone else was just 
clients - in which surely what you need is a *forward* proxy.

&gt;<i> The configuration we need to do in squid.conf file, I need help with that.
</I>&gt;<i> Could anyone provide me sample config file that would help me set this up? or
</I>&gt;<i> any directions will be much appreciated.
</I>
Please explain what you are trying to achieve - what problem you are trying to 
solve - what you want to happen as a result of inserting this &quot;magic Squid 
box&quot; into your network.

Once we know that, we might be able to help you constructively.


Regards,


Antony.
