For me, this still does not compute.

How is a user at home or on a mobile data connection going to find your reverse 
proxy?

How is this easier than having their equipment configured to use a forwarding 
proxy?

What is your understanding of the purpose of a reverse proxy?

</I>
Give me an example - what DNS name would a user connect to, and what would 
that DNS name resolve to, in order to end up on your reverse proxy?
