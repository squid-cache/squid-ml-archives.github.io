You may want to double-check that and redesign how the proxy is used.
Squid can easily do things like receive traffic on multiple IP:port and
selectively perform authentication only for traffic arriving in one.

No. Actually the preferred HTTP authentication schemes do not send any
confidential things in-channel over the network, so do not require HTTPS
protections.

The Basic and Digest auth schemes which could have benefited normally
have to be sent unprotected over TCP instead.


( Ironically that sad situation is due to the Browser developers behind
a certain &quot;TLS/HTTPS everywhere&quot; campaign refusing for _decades_ to
implement TLS to proxies. Directly counter to our campaign to get them
to use TLS where it is actually most needed. )

I think what you are wanting is something like below. Then you just need
your testing to send traffic to the right port:

 # reverse-proxy HTTP
 http_port 80 accel
 acl port80 myportname 80

 # forward-proxy HTTP
 http_port 3128
 acl port3128 myportname 3128

 # reverse-proxy HTTPS
 https_port 443 accel cert=...
 acl port443 myportname 443

 # forward-proxy TLS-explicit
 https_port 8443
 acl port8443 myportname 8443

 auth_param ... your auth setup
 acl auth proxy_auth REQUIRED

 acl noauth ... something to determine non-auth testing.

 # ... http_access rules testing things that do not require auth

 # emulate the &quot;deny all&quot; ending the non-auth checks
 http_access deny noauth

 # requires auth ...
 http_access deny !auth

 # ... rules testing things that require auth credentials.


Depending on what you want your test proxy behaviour to be you can
wrangle up some very cool behaviours with the any-of and all-of ACL
types in recent versions, or various lists of ACLs following one of the
port name ones.
