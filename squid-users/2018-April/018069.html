Then the issue is probably not with Squid. Something outside Squid is
causing the issue - either the VM itself, or the network setup.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why just an IP change affected the performance of web browsing ????
</I>
We do not know the answer to that. None of the info so far shows any
sign of such a problem. Something you have not thought to provide yet
contains the clues.

Perhapse taking a look through the available logs (both Squid and
others) might find better information and ideas.


&gt;<i> Maybe because of something relative to Dansguardian ???

Maybe yes, maybe no. see above.
