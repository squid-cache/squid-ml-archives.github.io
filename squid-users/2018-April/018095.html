SquidGuard is deprecated software and no longer maintained. Modern Squid
can do almost everything it provided, and the remaining cases can/should
use ufdbguard instead.

DansGuardian is also in a similar position. I'm not sure if it is being
maintained still or not, there is an e2Guardian fork project that has a
lot more recent updates though.


As for performance it depends on what you have them doing:

* URL-rewrite helpers (eg SquidGuard) work by having Squid generate a
second transaction from the &quot;redirected&quot; URL results. That slows down
and uses more memory than regular request processing in Squid.

* chained proxies (eg DansGuardian) require the traffic to be formatted
as HTTP traffic during each hop delivery and re-parsed re-processed by
every proxy along the way. Which naturally adds a bunch of delay overheads.

As a general rule; the less you have SquidGuard doing the more efficient
it is. The less you have DansGuardian doing the more those re-parse
overheads reduce any performance gains.
