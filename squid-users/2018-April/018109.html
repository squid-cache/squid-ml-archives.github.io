    <A HREF="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1172">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1172</A>
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Due to incorrect pointer handling Squid is vulnerable to denial
 of service attack when processing ESI responses.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 This problem allows a remote server delivering ESI responses
 to trigger a denial of service for all clients accessing the
 Squid service.

 This problem is limited to Squid operating as reverse proxy.

__________________________________________________________________

Updated Packages:

 This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.0.13.

 In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
 releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 3.5:
 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2018_3.patch">http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID-2018_3.patch</A>&gt;

 If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
 to the package vendor for availability information on updated
 packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

 All Squid-2.x and older are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.0 and older version are not vulnerable.

 All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.x versions up to and including 3.4.14 built with
 --disable-ssl are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.x versions up to and including 3.4.14 built without
 --enable-ssl are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.x versions up to and including 3.5.27 built without
 --enable-esi are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.1.12.2 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.1.23 built with --enable-esi and--enable-ssl, and being
 used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.2.0.8 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.2.14 built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being
 used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.3 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.3.14 built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being
 used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.4 and later versions up to and including
 Squid-3.4.14 built with --enable-esi and --enable-ssl, and being
 used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.5 versions up to and including 3.5.27 built without
 --with-openssl are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.5 and later versions up to and including 3.5.27 built
 with --enable-esi and --with-openssl, and being used for
 reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

 All Squid-4 versions up to and including 4.0.12 built without
 --with-openssl are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-4 versions up to and including 4.0.12 built with
 --with-openssl and being used for reverse-proxy are vulnerable.

__________________________________________________________________

Workarounds:

Either;

 Build Squid with --disable-esi

Or,

 Build Squid-3.1 to 3.4.14 or later with &quot;--disable-ssl&quot;

Or,

 Build Squid-3.5 or later with &quot;--without-openssl&quot;
