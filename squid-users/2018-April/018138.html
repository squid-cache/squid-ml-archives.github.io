I'll open an issue on the repo.  I did already fork it to add the 'use
a proxy' functionality, and would be happy to contribute such
functionality.  Would be a good way to get my head around it all
anyway.

Thanks for explaining - I'll look into that, but I can see what you mean.

</I>
Right.  I understand in a traditional transparent proxy environment
we'd handle this with iptables/pf.

Short of making Redbot behave better, through a proxy, is there a
solution I can use that will get me through my demo (I have to demo
this tomorrow) without resorting to a bunch of curls?  As long as
Redbot can make requests to a bunch of URLs and I can show the results
in the browser (failures and successes), I can worry about doing it
properly later - this is a throw-away environment, and won't exist
after the demo.  The point of the demo is to show the proxy working
and being used by a web app.

Thanks for your time and insight - this is all tremendously useful and
informative.

S.
