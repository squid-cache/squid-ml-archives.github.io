I was wondering about these, that's a good hint.

&gt;<i>  * do you have any refresh_pattern rules forcing it to do so?
</I>
Aye, some files were CSS files which are forced into caching. I was
speculating that the refresh_patterns might be involved, but didn't
see the connection.

&gt;<i>  * what version of Squid are you running?
</I>
3.5.21 on whatever patches SUSE baked into it.


&gt;<i>  * have you tried the latest Squid version?
</I>&gt;<i>  there have been a few fixes in detection this protocol version for
</I>&gt;<i> Squid-4.
</I>
Sadly non-negotiable, I'll have to make do (or tell them, ultimatively,
that it can't be done).

&gt;<i> Squid is apparently receiving HTTP/0.9 response objects (a raw data
</I>&gt;<i> stream of octets) not HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 objects (stream of messages
</I>&gt;<i> with specific start and end points to each message object).
</I>
Yup, will look into how *that* is happening.

&gt;<i> How do you determine that &quot;successful&quot; for the server?
</I>&gt;<i>  using any tool that hides away the protocols octet-level format
</I>&gt;<i> details
</I>&gt;<i>  (eg curl, wget, browser, etc) can hide the HTTP/0.9 oddity from
</I>&gt;<i> view.
</I>
Yeah, I've only been loooking at high-level clients since that's pretty
much where it broke; since it at least by assumption had always been
&quot;working&quot; (read: no visible/reported breakage) thus far, I didn't
bother to check for this; especially as the application hasn't been
updated in the timeframe where errors were reported.

&gt;<i> Locate the URL which was originally requested by the client. The
</I>&gt;<i> first line of the cache file should be a single byte representing the
</I>&gt;<i> request-method, then the URL in plain-text ending with newline (\n). 
</I>
my grep line handily found those; another option is to grep for '-1\s*-
1 unknown' in the cache_store_log, as there's a direct connection
between broken object storage and lack of cache timing, as we've found
out since I wrote the mail.

Kudos for the hints, Amos, they're great and'll help me a lot
(tomorrow, it's 22.54 local here).
