Your guess is wrong. The TCP level setup is only between Squid and the
client. It has to have completed before the TLS stuff can begin.

The first fake-CONNECT is done after TCP connection setup to see whether
the client is allowed to perform TLS inside it - and how Squid handles
that TLS.

You are right about that in relation to TCP.

But TCP is already over and done with by the time the fake-CONNECT gets
generated. So wrong about ICAP's lack of involvement - it may (or not) be.

NP: The only thing fake about the early CONNECT's is that the client did
not actually generate it. They are handled in Squid same as a regular
CONNECT message would be.
