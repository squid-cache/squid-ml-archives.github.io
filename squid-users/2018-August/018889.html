<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Your guess is wrong. The TCP level setup is only between Squid and the client. It has to have completed before the TLS stuff can begin.
</I>So when does Squid start setting up the TCP connection with the origin server ? After setting up a TCP connection with client and identifying it to be TLS ? 

What would this log message likely mean then ? I was reading that as 78477ms was the time it took for Squid to connect to 173.194.142.186 on port 443 and Squid and client(not the origin server) had already established a TCP connection beforehand (while it(squid) tries connecting to the remote server on port 443).
1533612202.312  78477 &lt;ip&gt; NONE_ABORTED/000 0 CONNECT 173.194.142.186:443 - HIER_NONE/- -

That would imply two things.
1) It took a lot of time for clients to set up a TCP connection with Squid given Chrome's dev tools 
2) Second, Squid took a while to establish a connection with origin server. 

Moreover, my ICAP settings look like this,
icap_service localicap reqmod_precache <A HREF="icap://127.0.0.1:1345/reqmod">icap://127.0.0.1:1345/reqmod</A> bypass=on routing=off on-overload=wait

ICAP would come into the picture only after I see a GET request in the access.log, right?

Sarfaraz

Your guess is wrong. The TCP level setup is only between Squid and the client. It has to have completed before the TLS stuff can begin.

The first fake-CONNECT is done after TCP connection setup to see whether the client is allowed to perform TLS inside it - and how Squid handles that TLS.

</I>&gt;<i> (assuming that even the TCP connections have not been set up yet) so 
</I>&gt;<i> that is safe to rule out. Am I right here ?

You are right about that in relation to TCP.

But TCP is already over and done with by the time the fake-CONNECT gets generated. So wrong about ICAP's lack of involvement - it may (or not) be.

NP: The only thing fake about the early CONNECT's is that the client did not actually generate it. They are handled in Squid same as a regular CONNECT message would be.
