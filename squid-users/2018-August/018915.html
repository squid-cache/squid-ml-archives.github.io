<PRE>I am very new to squid and have been trying to research an issue with the squid.conf file.  I see you can split the squid.conf file into different a number of different files using includes.

If I do split the rules up, does it increase the speed of processing the rules?    I was told it does, but in looking at information on the squid site, in how rules are processed, I can&#8217;t find anything that would lead me to believe that splitting out the rules into separate files would speed anything up.

The reason this is an issue, is because on AWS we have a load balancer and we spin up an instance and if it takes too long it tends to stop the instance.
