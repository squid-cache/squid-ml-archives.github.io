If by &quot;processing&quot; you mean applying configured rules to traffic at
runtime, then the answer is &quot;no&quot;. At runtime, Squid uses compiled rules,
and compiled rule application/checking speed does not depend on where
the rule were loaded/compiled from.


&gt;<i> I was told it does, but in looking at information on the squid

</I>
If the deployment environment loads/reads few large files slower than it
loads/reads many small files, then it is possible that using many small
configuration files will speed up Squid configuration.

Also, loading lots of ACL values/parameters from a file might be faster
than loading lots of ACL values/parameters embedded in squid.conf
(because it might be easier for Squid to find where each value
starts/ends in an external parameter file), but I have not tested that
theory, and, again, this theory only applies to Squid (re)configuration
delay, not runtime processing/performance.


&gt;<i> The reason this is an issue, is because on AWS we have a load balancer
</I>&gt;<i> and we spin up an instance and if it takes too long it tends to stop the
</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>
What is the approximate total size of your Squid configuration,
including all the external files that Squid has to load/parse while
configuring itself? What is the current startup delay with a
trivial/small rule set? What is the additional startup delay from
parsing all those rules?

Alex.
