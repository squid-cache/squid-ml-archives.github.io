Sorry, but why is a non-technical person trying to manage a proxy server?

To answer the question in your subject line &quot;Do I need to be technical to use 
squid proxy?&quot;, the answer is definitely &quot;no&quot;.  So long as you can use a 
browser, you can use Squid proxy, but if you want to *manage* the proxy, 
that's a different matter, and you need to have at least a certain amount of 
familiarity with networking concepts and client-server communications.

Maybe it helps to look at your request completely differently - what are you 
trying to *achieve* with Squid?  Tell us that and we might be able to help you 
do it.


Regards,


Antony.
