Well, you've certainly changed quite a lot of the standard config in the file 
you showed us earlier.

I seriously doubt you can be &quot;hacked&quot; (whatever you specifically mean by that) 
but only because you are running the Squid proxy on a domestic network and it 
is therefore almost certainly unreachable from the Internet.

However, defining &quot;safe ports&quot; to be &quot;any port at all&quot; means your proxy can be 
used for quite a number of protocols other than HTTP/S (for example, SMTP) and 
since this is almost certainly not what you want this proxy to be (ab)used 
for, you should stick the the default definition of safe ports which is 
designed to prevent this sort of abuse.

Just out of interest, what made you make the changes you did to the standard 
config?
