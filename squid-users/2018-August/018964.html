My recommendation is to use the default squid.conf file and see if you run into 
any problems.  If you do, come back and ask here with as much detail as you 
can gather on what the problem is, what shows up in the Squid log files when 
the problem is occurring, and how to trigger the problem.

&gt;<i> Main reason is caching
</I>
You should be aware that caching is less and less effective with modern web 
server practices.

I'm not saying it's not worth doing, but you won't get the cache hit rates we 
enjoyed 10 years ago.

&gt;<i> and controling kids
</I>
Maybe you need to define &quot;controlling&quot; a little more so we know what you want 
to do?

For example, is your primary objective to prevent them getting to sites you 
don't approve of, or finding out what sites they've been looking at after 
they've been there?
