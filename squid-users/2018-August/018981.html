Let's start with some basics...

1. What operating system have you installed Squid onto?

2. Which version have you installed?

3. How did you install Squid?

4. Did you follow any documentation telling you how to install and configure 
Squid?  If yes, show us the URL of the documentation you followed.

5. Are you using the standard Squid config file?  See
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/ConfiguringSquid">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/ConfiguringSquid</A> for examples.

6. Have you made any changes to the installed config file?  If so, give us 
details.

7. I'm assuming you are using a browser to access web sites via Squid.  Have 
you configured that browser to use a proxy, and entered the IP address and port 
number of Squid so the browser knows where to find it?

8. You say &quot;all Internet access is blocked&quot;.  Give us details of how you know 
this - copy and paste error messages, tell us which application/s are 
producing the messages, and preferably show us what appears in the Squid 
access log when you try to access the Internet.

Basically, please understand that we can only help you if we know:

 - what you're trying to acheive
 - what you've done so far
 - what's going wrong

otherwise we're just making guesses about your computer, your network, and 
your setup, which may be quite inaccurate.


Regards,


Antony.
