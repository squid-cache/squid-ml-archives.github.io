Well, let's just discuss &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; IP addresses for a moment.

If your proxy server's IP address starts with 192.168, then nobody on the 
Internet can get to it - it is only accessible to you on your local network.

The same applies if the address starts with 10, or with 172 followed by 
anything between 16 and 31.

If, on the other hand, your proxy's IP address does not match any of the 
above, then you are running it on a public IP address, and your configuration 
file is only allowing access from private addresses, which cannot be routed 
over the Internet.

That would be an explanation of why your proxy is denying access to your 
browser.

I would seriously question the wisdom of running a Squid proxy on a public IP 
address given your level of knowledge about networking, however.

In fact, you are wasting mine.

You have come here to get help from people who know more about Squid and 
networking than you do, and both I and others have spent time giving you 
advice and helping you to achieve what you want.

If you do not want to give us the information we need to understand what your 
setup is and what might be wrong with it, that's entirely up to you.


Regards,


Antony.
