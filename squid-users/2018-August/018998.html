Based on &quot;I am just learning nothing special no serious project&quot; and &quot;Just 
creating squid proxy for home use, my kids and I was also curious&quot;, I thought 
that was unlikely.

&gt;<i> That would be a different solution, but also on that FAQ page at 8.1

My guess is that Oldman has installed Squid on a Virtual Server he's obtained 
from some Internet-based hosting provider, and is then trying to access it 
from a browser on his home network.

If that's true (Oldman, I'm hoping you're still following this discussion, and 
have realised that people are genuinely trying to help you), then the Squid 
proxy will need a couple of lines such as:

	acl homenet src aa.bb.cc.dd
	http_access allow homenet

where aa.bb.cc.dd is the public IP of your home Internet connection.  If you 
don't know what this is, you can find out from <A HREF="https://whatsmyip.com/">https://whatsmyip.com/</A> (without 
using the proxy, of course).

I still advise extreme caution in running a Squid server on a public IP 
address, however.


Regards,


Antony.
