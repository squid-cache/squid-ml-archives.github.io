I know what you mean.  I had for the most part put Oldman's attitude down to 
ignorance of networking and related technical stuff, however given the stunning 
silence on his part since he accused us (or mostly me) of wanting to get 
access to his Squid server and claiming that I was wasting his time, I'm 
thinking that either:

a) you're right, and our collective reasonableness has made him realise that 
we're not easily trolled, so he's gone somewhere else, or

b) he's considered that there might actually be something useful in what 
several people here have been telling him, so he's gone away to read some more 
(hopefully useful) documentation about Squid and how to use it.

Either way it bemuses me that someone who introduces himself as &quot;not very 
technical&quot; chooses to have the email address <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">admin at daraksun.com</A>

If he's the admin, I wonder what the user experience is like...

Oh well,
