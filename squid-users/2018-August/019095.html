I assume you meant to say <A HREF="https://google.com">https://google.com</A> ?

No.

If the client is configured not to use a proxy (and you say you want to use 
intercept mode) then the client itslf will already have done the DNS lookup 
(otherwise it wouldn't know which IP address to send the request to).

If Squid then intercepts the request, it will already have a destination IP 
address, and Squid has no reason to do a DNS lookup.  If it didn't and perhaps 
found a different IP address than the client did (which is entirely possible 
with CDNs etc) and decided to send the request there instead, things would 
break once the reply got back to the client because it would see a reply from 
an address it didn't send a request to.

If in fact you are asking how to convert IPv4 requests to IPv6 requests then I 
seriously doubt that this can be done using Squid in intercept mode at all 
(however I've never wanted to try it).
