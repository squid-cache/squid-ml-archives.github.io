These concepts describe activities at different layers:

* SSL bumping is, in Squid context, inspection of SSL traffic that often
also involves impersonating the origin server and decrypting encrypted
HTTP traffic (i.e. a MitM attack on the client-server HTTPS communication).

* SSL interception is, in this context, directing (TCP/IP traffic that
presumably carries) SSL traffic off its &quot;natural&quot; TCP/IP path so that it
gets to Squid. Interception itself works at protocol layers below SSL
and HTTP. What happens when the SSL traffic gets to Squid is outside
&quot;SSL interception&quot; scope.

Usually, folks intercept SSL traffic to bump it, but YMMV. It is
possible, for example, to simply log TCP-level information about the
intercepted traffic without any MitM attacks on SSL.


&gt;<i> 2. What is the difference between &quot;http_port 3128 intercept&quot; and &quot;http_port
</I>&gt;<i> 3128 transparent&quot;? Do i need to setup the http_port as either of these?
</I>
The difference is in whether Squid impersonates the IP client, but you
need neither because your &quot;clients are explicitly configured to connect
through the proxy server&quot;. You do not need to divert traffic from its
natural TCP/IP path to proxy it because that natural TCP/IP path already
goes through your proxy.


&gt;<i> 3. Do I need to create self-signed certs on the proxy server and distribute
</I>&gt;<i> it to the client and application server?
</I>
* Yes if you want to inspect encrypted HTTP traffic of your client
application (i.e. get to the HTTP stuff inside the SSL layer).

* Yes if you want client to be able to read Squid-generated error pages.

* No otherwise. In this case, Squid will be just a blind TCP tunnel.


What do you want to use Squid for? The answer to that question has a
significant effect on your Squid configuration.


&gt;<i> # And finally deny all other access to this proxy
</I>&gt;<i> http_access allow all
</I>
FWIW, your rule does not match the comment and creates an open proxy.
Both are bad.


HTH,

Alex.
