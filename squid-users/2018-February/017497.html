</I>Unless you are using ssl-bump/peek and splice (which will be show up a 
warning in the browser if squid's CA in not installed in its list of 
authorities) the traffic is tunneled through squid still encrypted. You 
can't see anything but the domain part of the URL.

If you are bumping, and have installed CAs into browsers, just, of 
course it's possible for a proxy admin to see the plaintext.

Cheers
