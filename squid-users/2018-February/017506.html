<PRE>Hey Ahmad,

What you need is a router\nat proxy that can do this for you.
Squid alone cannot do that.
If you really need such a thing you will need to write a router which supports tproxy and will be the edge of your squid or another proxy.
What can do in another way is to write a backend proxy that intercepts the connections and hands them over to the local squid instance with a PROXY protocol enabled and this will force squid to fake the outgoing address of the &quot;client&quot; that the backend states the client is.
It's not simple to handle but with enough knowledge it is possible.
I know it works for IPv4 but I think that Squid-Cache yet to support the PROXY protocol with IPv6.
If ineed squid supports IPv6 then it's doable but I believe you will need another software then Squid-Cache which will be customized only for your requirement.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Subject: [squid-users] need outgoing addresses without duplication over big pool of addresses

Hello Folks .

I&#8217;m trying to deploy squid with IPV6 solution that can give me outgoing address without any duplication .

say i have 10 millions of ip addresses on server ( IPV6 addresses ) /64 subnet .

and i have single port as back connect that will rotate the eternal ip address from that list of addresses for each request 


I&#8217;m aware of squid random acl but there is like 1.5 % duplication over 1 hour  which i guess its normal behaviour for rotation random protocol .

my question is  :

what options in squid ACL or random algorithm that can randomise each request without any kind of duplication .

is there a way that we let squid on each request have outgoing address in sequence way .

say i have 10 millions of ips

and if i i made 10 millions of request i have 10 million non duplication outgoing address ?

plz let me know if this can be done from squid 

or  other tools like HA
or operation system itself .

i was searching BTW about NAT66 but couldn&#8217;t find any way to make NAT from IPV6 to other IPV6 

i know No nat needed with IPV6 , but i found new kernels do support MASQ in IPV6 Nat .

lets hope we have great discussion and best practise on achieving the goal above .


cheers
