There is also squid3 in SLES11-SP4 and that will exist for a little
while still. But that has SysV init.d scripts though.


&gt;<i> Also, be aware that systemd is not compatible with Squid-3 and packages

In most cases there is no choice in the matter. For example, SLES12 (so
Leap 42 for openSUSE) is all systemd based and it's been around since
squid 3.3.x days. But the service file there is using squid to manage
squid so it's not that bad ;)

Like it's often in software, sometimes you reach for ideal but then when
you have to ship something you crease and cram to get it in the box ;)
