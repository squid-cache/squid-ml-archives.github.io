Please show us the Squid configuration file (omitting comments and blank lines) 
- that will show us what you've asked Squid to do.

</I>
Show us what turns up in your Squid access log and your Squidguard blocking 
log (sorry, I'm not familiar with what this might properly be called, but I 
assume Squidguard has a log file showing which requests it has blocked) when 
such a request gets made.

Please try to:

a) restrict what you show us to only the user / IP making the request (no need 
to include other users' requests going through Squid at the same time)

b) include *everything* relating to that user, even if you think something 
might not be relevant

c) copy and paste the text from the log files, don't send a screenshot (osrry 
if that's obvious, but you might be surprised what some people do)


That will give us some idea of what's working and what isn't.


Regards,


Antony.
