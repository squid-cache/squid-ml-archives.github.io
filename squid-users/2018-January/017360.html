I mean, will not actually result in a persistent connection -- a socket
that is reused for multiple HTTP transactions.  I suppose for CONNECT
it would mean either multiple CONNECTs within a single socket or one
CONNECT with multiple &quot;GET/POST&quot; type transactions within it.

&gt;<i> CONNECT can be pipelined after other requests on a persistent

So, for the purposes of the WWW's current move towards all-https
websites, persistent connections (perhaps only with proxy servers?) are
becoming useless?

&gt;<i> CONNECT tunnels specifically end when the server sends FIN to Squid
</I>
So this seems to affirm my question above that in a world where all
websites are https, persistent connections are no more and we are back
to open-fetch-close for every single object on a webpage, yes?

The problem I am trying to solve here is that opening Chrome with, say,
a few hundred tabs open, seems to take about an hour for it to finally
fetch all of the pages while most sit spinning on &quot;waiting for an
available socket&quot; or &quot;proxy tunnel&quot;, etc., for a long time, which is
probably due to Chrome's limit on the number of concurrent sockets it
will open to a single destination, including proxy servers.  I was
hoping persistent connections would reduce the socket setup/teardown
overhead of all of that.

Cheers,
b.
