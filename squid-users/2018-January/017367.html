By this do you mean to say there is a connection from the client,
through the proxy server to the origin server?

&gt;<i>   2. An HTTP connection from the client to the proxy.

Understood.  So I do believe you are ACKing my question above.

&gt;<i> No, the optimization is still there as far as client-origin traffic

</I>
Except that it is all bottle-necked through the same open-TCP-socket
limitations that Chrome has to a single destination.  I think what I
want to see is those limited number of TCP-sockets better utilized. 
But maybe that cannot happen without pipelining.

&gt;<i> Yes, probably something like that is happening.
</I>
So how do I ameliorate it?

&gt;<i> Perhaps they do? How many requests does Chrome send inside a CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> tunnel through Squid, on average?
</I>
My short investigation using packet sniffing seems to indicate just
one.

&gt;<i> If you bump CONNECT tunnels using
</I>&gt;<i> SslBump, then you can use Squid to measure persistency. If you do not
</I>&gt;<i> bump, then you should still be able to use Chrome developer tools to
</I>&gt;<i> measure persistency.
</I>
Any clues about how do to do that?

&gt;<i> Origin server response delays rather than TCP handshakes may be your
</I>&gt;<i> primary bottleneck because Chrome probably does not pipeline and,
</I>&gt;<i> without pipelining, there can be at most one concurrent request per
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> connection.
</I>
I think Chrome disabled pipelining a while back:

<A HREF="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30477476/why-is-pipelining-disabled-in-modern-browsers">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30477476/why-is-pipelining-disabled-in-modern-browsers</A>

&gt;<i> To improve throughput in your environment (without raising
</I>&gt;<i> the number of TCP connections that Chrome is allowed to open), you
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> need to wait for HTTP/2 support. In HTTP/2, a single HTTP connection
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> carry lots of concurrent transactions.
</I>
So are people without proxies suffering this same issue?  I don't think
they are because their few hundred tabs will all be much more
distributed to various servers and domains across the Internet allowing
their Chrome to open many (many!) more parallel TCP connections and
wait for them all to respond in parallel.

It's the concentration of all of those potential TCP connections
through a single host -- the proxy server -- that is greatly reducing
the parallelism of fetching lots of objects at the same time and
dragging it's wall-clock time out.

Perhaps there is no solution until HTTP/2.

I just find it surprising that every IT person that utilizes a proxy
has to tell their users, &quot;yeah, that's just how it is here in this
network, very slow to start up your browser&quot;.  :-(

Cheers,
