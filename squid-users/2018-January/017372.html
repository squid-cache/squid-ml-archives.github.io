This could be a side effect of not supporting Vary caching in shared
memory: <A HREF="https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3806#c9">https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3806#c9</A>


&gt;<i> And disk cache hit ratio went up from 15-50% to stable 60-65%.

I hope your total/combined hit ratio improved overall.

No, there is no such size-discrimination code in Squid.

For a clean apples-to-apples test, make sure you use
&quot;memory_cache_shared on&quot; when using a single worker without rock cache_dirs.

Vary caching should be fixed as well, of course, but perhaps there is
another problem we do not know about. I would start by eliminating Vary
as the known problem. When using a test transaction, make sure the
response does not have a Vary header. Or configure Squid to log the Vary
header and remove the corresponding transactions when computing
adjusted-for-Vary memory cache hit ratio.


HTH,

Alex.
