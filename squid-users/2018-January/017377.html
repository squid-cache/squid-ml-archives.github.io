Yes, disk hits are delivered to workers via shared memory, but...

I disagree: A disk hit is still a lot slower than a memory hit because a
disk hit involves reading from a disk, which is a major performance
bottleneck.

The shared memory pages used to deliver disk hits to workers are then
reused for delivering other disk hits. Those pages are not a part of a
cache. Ideally, those pages could be added to (swapped with) the memory
cache pages (to avoid memory copying; when other conditions are met),
but Squid does not have the code to do that yet. We do not even have the
code to serve hits from shared memory -- we copy the bytes from shared
to local memory first.

Alex.
