I suspect I'll be getting 10k+ numbers within another week or two. That's when I'll have to restart squid if I don't want the system to come to a network crawl.

Sorry I have a bit of a distraction going on ATM so have not got to that 
detailed check yet. Good to hear you found a slightly better situation 
though.


&gt;<i> By the way, what does &quot;Largest file desc currently in use&quot; mean exactly? Should this value also drop (eventually) under sane conditions?
</I>
The OS assigns FD numbers and prefers to assign with a strong bias 
towards the lowest values. So that can be seen as a fluctuating &quot;water 
level&quot; of approximately how many FD are currently in use. If there are a 
few very long-lived connections and many short ones it may be variably 
incorrect - but is good enough for a rough guide of FD usage.

In normal network conditions it should rise and fall with your peak vs 
off-peak traffic times. I expect with your particular trouble it will 
mostly just go upwards.
