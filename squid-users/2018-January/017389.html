The combination of the three statements above may be a sign of a problem
unrelated to Vary: Since the disk cache can cache everything the memory
cache can and is typically much larger than the memory cache, the
incapacitation of a memory cache (due to Vary) should not have a
significant effect on overall hit ratio. It should only affect hit
response time.

The only known culprit I can think of in this context are hits for
being-cached objects: Rock lacks code that allows Squid to read
being-written objects. The shared memory cache has that code already. If
your workload has a lot of cases where clients request a being-written
object, then the overall hit ratio should go down after the memory cache
incapacitation (due to Vary).

I suspect something else is in play here though, especially if you see a
different picture with Squid v4 -- the known problem discussed above is
present in all Squid versions. I second Amos's recommendation to focus
on v4 because it is unlikely that any complicated problems are going to
be fixed in v3, even if you triage them well.


HTH,

Alex.
