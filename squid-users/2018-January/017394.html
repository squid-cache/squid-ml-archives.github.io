Just to avoid misunderstanding, please note that Vary is a response header.

This matches the current suspicion that there is something wrong with
the shared memory cache (in your environment).

&gt;<i> It's not like it makes any sense but how about random example url:

</I>
I cannot confirm that: In primitive wget tests with Squid v3.5 (bzr
r14182), I am getting shared memory hits with the above URL, with or
without cache_dirs, with or without SMP.
