I wonder how you react to emails from your users which contain so little 
specific information as I see below.

&gt;<i> I've been dealing with a computer that can access all the services for days,
</I>&gt;<i> except that I can not surf the Internet.
</I>
Was it previously able to surf the Internet?

If yes, when did this change?

Did anything else happen on your network at the same time as this change?

&gt;<i> The message
</I>
Please show us the full text of the message.

&gt;<i> the browser
</I>
Which browser are you using?

&gt;<i> sends me is that the server
</I>
Which server?

&gt;<i> is rejecting the connections,
</I>
Is any reason given?  Any more detail at all?

&gt;<i> however the other domain pc
</I>
This is a Windows domain?  Not just a simple &quot;bunch of PCs on a network doing 
their own thing&quot;?  Do you need to authenticate to the domain (on *any* PC, I 
don't just mean on the one giving the problems) in order to be able to access 
websites?

&gt;<i> access without any problem to the web, and reinstalled the pc 2 times
</I>
Was the PC with the problem reinstalled or reconfigured shortly before it 
stopped being able to access websites?

I'm wondering what makes you think a reinstall might resolve the problem - you 
might be right, but is there any information which leads you to believe this?

&gt;<i> and nothing, the only thing that this pc I have to install windows xp,
</I>&gt;<i> because it works with a tool that requires that OS
</I>
Do you have any other Windows XP machines on your network?

If so, are any of those able to access websites?

&gt;<i> Greetings, please help me.
</I>
Please tell us where Squid fits into your question.
