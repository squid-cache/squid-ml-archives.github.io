You are probably right. A few days ago, while working on an unrelated
project, we have found a bug in delay pools support for tunneled https
traffic. That support was probably broken by v4 commit 6b2b6cf. We have
not tested v3.5, so I can only confirm that v4 and v5 are broken.

The bug will be fixed as a side effect of &quot;peering support for SslBump&quot;
changes that should be ready for the official review soon. If you would
like to test our unofficial branch, the code is available at

HTH,

Alex.
