</I>I was not aware of that - i can de-activate the workers 8 setting again.
&quot;Collapsed forwarding&quot; was not set intentionally. This error seems to occur when the disk is
really full and squid is restarted.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I cannot answer your question regarding overflowing AUFS
</I>&gt;<i> cache directories. One possibility is that Squid is not cleaning up old
</I>&gt;<i> cache files fast enough. You already set cache_swap_low/cache_swap_high
</I>&gt;<i> aggressively. Does Squid actively remove objects from the full disk
</I>&gt;<i> cache when you start it up _without_ any traffic? If not, it could be a
</I>&gt;<i> Squid bug. Unfortunately, nobody has worked on AUFS code for years
</I>&gt;<i> (AFAIK) so it may be difficult to fix anything that might be broken there.
</I>When there is no traffic squid seems to cleaning up well enough: over night (no traffic)
disk usage went down to 30GB (now it's at 50GB again)

There was another error i just fixed:
&gt;<i> FATAL: Failed to open swap log /mnt/cache/squid/swap.state.new
</I>Not a permissions or diskspace problem, caused by workers 8.
I have deactivated workers 8 and this error went away.

THX for your input!
