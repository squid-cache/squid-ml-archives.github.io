<PRE>Alex,

Just to be sure:
Every RSA key and certificate pair regardless to the origin server and the SSL-BUMP enabled proxy can be different.
If the key would be the exact same one then we will probably have a very big security issue/risk to my understanding (leaving aside DH).

Will it be more accurate to say that just as long as these 200 squid instances(different squid.conf and couple other local variables)
use the same exact ssl_db cache directory  then it's probable that they will use the same certificate.
Or these 200 squid instances are in SMP mode with 200 workers...
If these 200 instances do not share memory and certificate cache then there is a possibility that the same site from two different sources
will serve different certificates(due to the different RSA key which is different).

Thanks,
Eliezer

Certificates themselves are not used (directly) to decrypt traffic
AFAIK, but yes, both PCs will see the same server certificate (ignoring
CDNs and other complications).

If you are not bumping the connection, then both PCs will see the same
real Facebook certificate as if those PCs did not use a proxy.

If you are bumping the connection, then both PCs will see the same fake
certificate generated by Squid.



&gt;<i> say i used 200 proxies in same squid machine and i used to access FB from the same pc same browser .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> will facebook see my cert/key i used to decrypt its traffic ?
</I>
If you are asking whether Facebook will know anything about the fake
certificate generated by Squid for clients, then the answer is &quot;no,
unless Facebook runs some special client code to deliver (Squid)
certificate back to Facebook&quot;.

In general, the origin server assumes that the client is talking to it
directly. Clients may pin or otherwise restrict certificates that they
trust, but after the connection is successfully established, the server
may assume that it is talking to the client directly. A paranoid server
may deliver special code to double check that assumption, but there are
other, more standard methods to prevent bumping such as certificate
pinning and certificate transparency cervices.



&gt;<i> is the key/cert of FB to decrypt the https content is same on all browsers on all computers ?
</I>
If you are asking whether the generated certificates are going to be the
same for all clients, then the answer is &quot;yes, provided all those 200
Squids use the same configuration (including the CA certificate) and
receive the same real certificate from Facebook&quot;. Squid's certificate
generation algorithm generates the same certificate given the same
configuration and the same origin server certificate.


HTH,

Alex.
