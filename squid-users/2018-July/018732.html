<PRE>Alex,

Some properties of the certificate are static but...
A certificate is certifying a specific key.
If every certificate would be exactly the same as the other on all its properties including the key then we would be able to..
Fake any certificate in the world very very fast.

Correct me if I'm wrong:
Every certificate have the same properties of the original one except the &quot;RSA key&quot; part which it's certifiying.
There is a dynamic variable in every certificate when it's being created(not talking about time stamps...).

So what I'm saying is that you cannot say that every certificate which will be created with the same CA will be the same for two different 2048 bits RSA keys.

Let me know if I got it right.

Eliezer

I cannot find a reasonable interpretation of the above that would
contradict what I have said. Yes, each unique certificate has its own
private key, but that is not what Ahmad was asking about AFAICT.


&gt;<i> Will it be more accurate to say that just as long as these 200 squid
</I>&gt;<i> instances(different squid.conf and couple other local variables) use
</I>&gt;<i> the same exact ssl_db cache directory  then it's probable that they
</I>&gt;<i> will use the same certificate.
</I>
That statement is incorrect. Squids configured with different CA
certificates will generate different fake certificates for the same real
certificate.

I assume that Ahmad was asking about a situation where 200 Squid
instances had the same configuration (including CA certificates).

Please note that the certificate generator helper gets the signing (CA)
certificate as a parameter with each generation request (because
different Squid ports may use different CA certificates). Also, Squid
probably does not officially support sharing the certificate directory
across Squid instances (even if it works).


&gt;<i> Or these 200 squid instances are in SMP mode with 200 workers... If
</I>&gt;<i> these 200 instances do not share memory and certificate cache then
</I>&gt;<i> there is a possibility that the same site from two different sources 
</I>&gt;<i> will serve different certificates(due to the different RSA key which
</I>&gt;<i> is different).
</I>
200 SMP workers or 200 identically-configured Squid instances will
generate the same fake certificates for the same real certificate.
&quot;Stable certificates&quot; is an important requirement for many distributed
Squid deployments.

Alex.
