Agreed.

</I>
At TLS level, yes. However, one could argue that Squid should honor a
(higher level) client and server assumption that they are talking to
each other (at HTTP+ level). We will probably break fewer transactions
that way. With that idea in mind, the &quot;first point&quot; becomes establishing
a TCP tunnel with the server, even if no client Hello pieces are forwarded.


&gt;<i> Bumping at step1 does not involve any server information. So no pinning
</I>&gt;<i> required. The client is talking to *Squid* over TLS independent of how
</I>&gt;<i> the response is fetched.
</I>
True for TLS level. Not necessarily true for higher levels as discussed
above.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Case 1: We see that no pinning happens i.e. pinConnection() is not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> called at all. C1-&gt;S gets established, C1 is closed and then C2 re-uses S

</I>
&gt;<i> I think the described behaviour of C2 using S after C1 has pinned the
</I>&gt;<i> connection is a bug.
</I>
Your earlier &quot;Sending the client handshake to a server&quot; and &quot;Bumping at
step1&quot; statements contradict this statement AFAICT because both C1 and
C2 were bumped at step1 in &quot;Case 1&quot;.

FWIW, I would default to honor the tunnel until somebody presents a
convincing argument for making the behavior configurable. That is, like
you said, treat C2 reusing S (or, more precisely, not closing S when C1
is closed) as a Squid bug.


&gt;<i> * S should not be pooled as persistent until the client which triggered
</I>&gt;<i> its TCP open has finished with it (eg after the TLS handshake completes).
</I>
&gt;<i> * Once the handshake begins sending client data, whichever client was
</I>&gt;<i> opening it should pin it.
</I>
I agree that pinned connections should not be pooled. Bugs
notwithstanding, they are not pooled today IIRC.

I am not sure you meant that, but I doubt a hypothetical feature of
pooling before-sending-handshake/before-pinning connections is a good
idea, but it does not contradict &quot;pinned connections are not pooled&quot;
principle. In practice, once the TCP connection is established, the
requester pins it immediately (if needed) so there is no opportunity or
need for pooling.


&gt;<i> * The sequence of the above two should result in S being pinned before
</I>&gt;<i> it is ever considered for the persistence pool. Which should cause it to
</I>&gt;<i> be excluded from the servers pool.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> So IMO when these things are working properly, C2 server selection
</I>&gt;<i> should never even see that S exists let alone be able to use it.
</I>
The open question is whether S should be pinned in the case where C1 is
bumped at step1 (i.e., &quot;Case 1&quot; in Vishali's email). If S should be
pinned, then I agree with the above statement. If S should not be
pinned, then S is just a regular Squid-to-server connection that can be
pooled.


Cheers,

Alex.
