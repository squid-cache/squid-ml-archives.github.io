</I>
One could, but that is dependent on what the admin policy is.
Configuring persistence on/off is the way to control that, not pinning.

&gt;<i> We will probably break fewer transactions
</I>&gt;<i> that way. With that idea in mind, the &quot;first point&quot; becomes establishing
</I>&gt;<i> a TCP tunnel with the server, even if no client Hello pieces are forwarded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
HTTP(S) being stateless, at that level any endpoint relying on implicit
state is non-compliant and buggy. HTTP(S) agents are explicitly required
to include any necessary state references in each message generated.

It is *nice* not to result in visible errors, but not a requirement we
should stick to at cost of proper behaviour. HTTP and extensions also
specify required error handling in most cases where it matters.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bumping at step1 does not involve any server information. So no pinning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required. The client is talking to *Squid* over TLS independent of how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the response is fetched.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True for TLS level. Not necessarily true for higher levels as discussed
</I>&gt;<i> above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The client accepted proof that Squid *was* that origin (false or not)
order to reach said higher levels. Pinning at a later time due to higher
level stateful situation is not relevant to the bumping code actions and
not something we need to consider at the present C2 use of S after C1
should have pinned it.

The only cross-level requirement is to provide the surety that pinning
is a one-way action. Any level setting it makes the connections fate shared.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Case 1: We see that no pinning happens i.e. pinConnection() is not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> called at all. C1-&gt;S gets established, C1 is closed and then C2 re-uses S
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The code just happens to work this way (evidently). It is not something
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would rely on until the matter is discussed and settled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the described behaviour of C2 using S after C1 has pinned the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection is a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your earlier &quot;Sending the client handshake to a server&quot; and &quot;Bumping at
</I>&gt;<i> step1&quot; statements contradict this statement AFAICT because both C1 and
</I>&gt;<i> C2 were bumped at step1 in &quot;Case 1&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
 &quot;after C1 has pinned&quot; - if no pinning happens at all the whole
statement is irrelevant. Sorry for confusion.


&gt;<i> FWIW, I would default to honor the tunnel until somebody presents a
</I>&gt;<i> convincing argument for making the behavior configurable. That is, like
</I>&gt;<i> you said, treat C2 reusing S (or, more precisely, not closing S when C1
</I>&gt;<i> is closed) as a Squid bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What I'm most confused about here is why S is closed when C1 dies with
non-pinning.  _unless_ there is pinning between them they should not be
that closely fate sharing.

Is the HTTPS message on both C1 and S saying &quot;Connection: close&quot; perhapse?
 If so the closure relationship is an illusion.
 But then, why would C2 be using a connection currently in-use by C1 in
a way that starts *after* C1 closure? (so not collapsed forwarding AFAIK)

Something smells fishy.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * S should not be pooled as persistent until the client which triggered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its TCP open has finished with it (eg after the TLS handshake completes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Once the handshake begins sending client data, whichever client was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening it should pin it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that pinned connections should not be pooled. Bugs
</I>&gt;<i> notwithstanding, they are not pooled today IIRC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure you meant that, but I doubt a hypothetical feature of
</I>&gt;<i> pooling before-sending-handshake/before-pinning connections is a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea, but it does not contradict &quot;pinned connections are not pooled&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> principle. In practice, once the TCP connection is established, the
</I>&gt;<i> requester pins it immediately (if needed) so there is no opportunity or
</I>&gt;<i> need for pooling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Off-topic; TLS has connections that do not use handshakes at all, which
are becoming more common in TLS/1.3. So I believe such a feature may be
coming one day, but irrelevant right now.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The sequence of the above two should result in S being pinned before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is ever considered for the persistence pool. Which should cause it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be excluded from the servers pool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So IMO when these things are working properly, C2 server selection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should never even see that S exists let alone be able to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The open question is whether S should be pinned in the case where C1 is
</I>&gt;<i> bumped at step1 (i.e., &quot;Case 1&quot; in Vishali's email). If S should be
</I>&gt;<i> pinned, then I agree with the above statement. If S should not be
</I>&gt;<i> pinned, then S is just a regular Squid-to-server connection that can be
</I>&gt;<i> pooled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
IMO in *that* specific case S should not be pinned. Because pinning
would prevent the very reasonable actions of handling server failures by
opening new Sn connections to finish incomplete responses to the client,
or retaining a server connection for the quick_abort features.

Squid should instead be ensuring that the server handshake at TLS level
matches what it would have used for C2 clean handshake. I may have
missed it, but that is not yet being done (just TCP equivalence, not TLS).
