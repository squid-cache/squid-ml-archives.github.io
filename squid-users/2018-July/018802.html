I do not know of any specific services like that, but it is easy to
imagine one. For example, consider a server that sends the client the
number of requests that sever has seen on the current TCP connection. A
client expecting to receive &quot;1&quot; in its first response may break after
receiving &quot;10&quot; instead. And it gets worse when Squid-to-server
connections are picked at random for every request.

Like Amos said, HTTP allows the proxy to do juggle to-server connections
like that, so no reasonable plain text client that goes through a proxy
would expect a pinned server connection, but in our &quot;secure&quot; context, a
reasonable client can expect that it is talking directly to the service
at HTTP level.


&gt;<i> 3. Is Pinning maintained at SSL level?? When the&#160;connection is pooled,
</I>&gt;<i> do you save SSL session states ??
</I>
Yes and yes: The kind of pinning we are talking about is maintained at
&quot;destination connection&quot; level (see #3 in my earlier response), which
includes both TCP and SSL connection info.


&gt;<i> 4. We are looking forward to do an optimization&#160;where the same
</I>&gt;<i> TCP&#160;connection from squid to server is re-used for multiple requests
</I>&gt;<i> from client. Will that be a valid process with squid??&#160;
</I>
As the first step, I would post a specific RFC (to the squid-dev mailing
list) to see if there is consensus that what you want is officially
acceptable in principle. Please mention the motivation and include
risk/benefit analysis along with Squid configuration changes (if any).
Then comes implementation and official review.

For more details, please see <A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/MergeProcedure">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/MergeProcedure</A>

N.B. The same TCP connection from squid to server is _already_ reused
for multiple requests from client so what you probably want to optimize
is something different (e.g., the same Squid-to-server TLS connection is
reused for multiple consecutive TLS clients).


HTH,

Alex.
