<PRE>I seem to remember reading that one way to improve reliability is to have
your proxy software be able to double as a web-server for WPAD.dat.

Is there a published means for doing this w/squid or would something need
to be cobbled together?

I'm currently running a small internal-only webs-server (lighttpd) which
is still slowly suffering from creeping featurism and takes 
re-en-lightening
myself with new SW updates and just thinking some way to do the same
in squid might make for 1 less piece of SW to think about configuring and
keeping alive (not that it needs to do much).

Of course, in addition to updates, there's always the temptation to do
more with it, internally, and probably mangling my wpad server in the
process (at least until I caught it).

Anyway, given the advice in the wiki regarding WPAD and the reliability of
having it in your proxy, it seemed like it might be something that's come
up before...(?)  Would seem to be just a matter of listening for
requests on port 80 (wpad+proxy at same IP) and serving up the
wpad.dat static file.
