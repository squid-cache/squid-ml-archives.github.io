	Seems like that is mostly about setting one up.

	I already have a working one, but in reading docs on the squid wiki
it was suggested that having your proxy being able to 'double' as 
your web-proxy was one way to reduce some complexity -- so I wasn't 
trying to set one up -- already did that with a smallish webserver that
serves up my wpad.dat file, with dns and dhcp records both pointing at
that resource -- seems to work find for all tested browsers.

	It's the merge thingy that likely wouldn't be in a standard toolset
that does something like what Jeffery maybe had done that might suffice.

I'll have to try that to give it a spin.

To someone else's setup question, I threw my current dns-like settings at them
and mentioned how   wpad needs to be contacted before the proxy as wpad is 
supposed to tell a browser where the proxy is or which proxy to use.

Thanks for the pointers though!
