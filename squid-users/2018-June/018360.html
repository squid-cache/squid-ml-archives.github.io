<PRE>Hey Edward,

First congrats!.
I hope we can help you to figure out the relevant details.

I am not sure why you have spoken to AWS teams about Squid-Cache, may I ask what OS are you using in AWS?
Also what version of Squid are you using?
The timeout settings are &quot;critical&quot; indeed but depends on what you are using and doing with Squid-Cache.
Despite to the fact that <A HREF="https://www.visolve.com/squid/squid30/timeout">https://www.visolve.com/squid/squid30/timeout</A> Is in a way still a lead it's not &quot;up-to-date&quot;

Please note that without understanding what issues have you been facing and the purpose of the Squid-Cache instance(s?) there is no way to even guess what might fit your needs.

Eliezer

Subject: [squid-users] Connection Timeouts

We had a person leave and I got selected to update and maintain our squid proxy.   We are talking to AWS and they told us that we needed to change the connection_timeout value from the default to 5 min.

We have people stress testing out installation and I was concerned that if connection timeouts are too long we may see congestion. 

Should I be worried that connection timeouts will use up file descriptors at a higher rate?

And what might be the options?

Doing and internet search I found a web page at <A HREF="https://www.visolve.com/squid/squid30/timeout.php">https://www.visolve.com/squid/squid30/timeout.php</A> and in the TIMEOUT description I read

&#8220;TIMEOUT
Timeout parameters in Squid can be based on overall connection timeouts, peer-specific timeouts, site/domain-specific timeouts, request-specific timeouts etc. Proper setting of timeout values is critical to optimal Squid performance. Relevant parameters for timeout settings are listed&#8221;

Is it possible to narrow the connection timeout to a specific site?  I looked at the website information, squid documentation and did an internet search.

I did not see anything that narrowed the timeout to a specific timeout. 

I am trying to set connection timeouts to AWS sites, but keep connection timeouts to the default, because it is working well.
