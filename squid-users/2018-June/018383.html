<PRE>Amos,

Systemd can be define to run a specific command for a &quot;reload&quot; and even if nobody wrote the line in a service file it's there since almost day one of systemd services.

And.. if the version is el6 I believe it's still a sysVinit based system.
Squid -kparse should detect and squid -kreconf should resolve any issue if it's not a fatal one that stopped the service.

Not directly related but.. only if Squid doesn't release at all any memory it catches then a restart would be a must at some point.
&gt;<i>From what I have seen in the 2.7 and 3.x code in the past it seems that there should be some level of memory cleanup\release.
</I>Also I have systems that has up-time of almost a year so I am a bit confused why should a restart would be requied?
... if I have acls handled by an external acl or ICAP service then why should I restart?

Correct.

Exact same line and issue? or other ones elsewhere in the config?

NP: &quot;squid -k parse&quot; should be used to find any issues after an upgrade.
It does not halt on the first FATAL/ERROR if there are many.

By &quot;service squid restart&quot; I take it that you are using systemd to
control a Squid-3 proxy. systemd cannot cope at all well with software
like Squid which is itself a daemon manager.

Try stopping Squid with the &quot;squid -k shutdown&quot; command (repeat of
necessary) and making sure Squid is fully stopped with no processes
still running before you start it again.

With systemd the &quot;squid -k ...&quot; commands (or init.d script, if any)
should be used to manage Squid-3 instead of systemd's &quot;service ...&quot;
commands.

NP: these issues have been resolved in Squid-4. So this is a temporary
situation until you can upgrade.
