*If* that mechanism is used there is no difference in the commands. If
it is not used, the systemd ones are actively dangerous. So no harm in
advising the safe one be used in either case.

Cheadle was using systemd's &quot;service ...&quot; commands. Which I am advising
to avoid because something indeterminate is going wrong with the config
loading and startup process. If the OS is actually SysV those systemd
commands are even more inappropriate.

</I>
The admin has apparently got themselves into a difficult situation and
it is no longer clear whether systemd or Squid master process is in
control of the worker processes which are running and with what config.
They both fight over &quot;service ...&quot; commands.

The only thing which is guaranteed to restore Squid to known state is a
full shutdown. Ensuring that everything has exited before proceeding
with the start action.
