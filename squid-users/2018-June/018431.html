<PRE>Hello,

I'm setting up a Squid proxy as a cache for a number (as many as possible)
of identical JAVA applications to run their web calls through. The calls are
ofc identical, and the response they get can safely be cached for 5-10
seconds. 
I do this because most of the calls is directed at a single server on the
internet that I don't want to hammer, since I will ofc be locked out of it
then.

Currently Im simply testing this on a single computer: the application and
squid

The calls from the application is done using ssl / https by telling java to
use Squid as a proxy (-Dhttps.proxyHost and -Dhttp.proxyHost). I've set up
squid and JAVA with self-signed certificates, and the application sends its
calls through squid and gets the reponse. No problem there (wasnt easy that
either I must say :P ).

The problem is that none of the calls get cached: All rows in the access.log
hava a TCP_MISS/200 tag in them. 

I've searched all through the web for a solution to this, and have tried
everything people have suggested. So I was hoping someone could help me?

Anyone have any tips on what to try?

MY config (note Ive set the refresh_pattern like that just to see if I could
catch anything. The plan is to modify it so it actualyl does refresh the
responses frmo the web calls in 5-10 seconds intervals. There are commented
out pats Ive tried with no luck there too):
