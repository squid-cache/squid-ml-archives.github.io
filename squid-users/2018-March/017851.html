<PRE>Dear Team

squid  3.1.20 reverse proxy server running on Linux Debian, This has been
set up a few years before and working fine.

Recently we are planning to host a new site on our local windows server and
setup for external access using squid proxy, so we tried to modify by
adding the new site info in the squid config file for external access.

After modifying the config file, we are able to access the site externally
but the site didn't redirect automatically to HTTPS like other sites we set
up before. so I tried to remove the code lines I added in the config file
to restore it to the original setting, but now all our existing site are
not redirecting automatically to https.

Any idea what went wrong and how this can be refixed.

I have tried to restart the Squid service and also the server, still not
working as expected
