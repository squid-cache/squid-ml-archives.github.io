<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am using squid 3.5 for windows as a transparent proxy to provide internet access to 7 servers in a secure environment that otherwise does not have internet access. I have two squids running behind a load balancer, each one is running server 2016 core with 2 Xeon processors that is either haswell generation with 1:1 physical processor to virtual processor mapping or a hyper-threading Broadwell generation processor that is 1:1 logical processor to virtual processor mapping, depending on how they are provisioned when they get started.

Doing a bandwidth test directly in the VM I am able to get internet throughput of 800-1200 Mbps.

Doing a file copy to and from the VM I am able to get 1200 Mbps lan throughput.

In proxied uploads I have observed speeds as high as 120 Mbps, which is more than enough for what I need and the bottleneck is likely in the backup software rather than squid. Uploads performance I am not worried about where they are at now - even if I only got 20-30 Mbps it would be adequate for what I need it for.

Downloads however are very slow. Small files do not seem to be impacted. Using the test a thinkbroadband.com/download, files up to 20 Mb will download at a reasonable 20-30 Mbps, but when I get to 50, it slows down to about 17 Mbps, and when I download AD Connect from Microsoft, which is about 80 Mb, I can see it start at about 30 Mbps, but eventually goes down to about 115 kbps and levels off. When I put an IP on the server I am using for testing that proxies through squid, I am able to download the file at several hundred mbps.  When I download the same file on the squid server - I can't tell exactly what throughput I was getting, but the 80 Mb file downloaded within 5 seconds.

In both squid servers, other than when the servers were booting, processor activity has not exceeded 9% in the last 7 days but usually sits below 2%. Memory usage has not exceeded 2 Gb, leaving 2 Gb free.

I am using OpenDNS for a DNS source, and have tried changing DNS to level3 but it made no performance difference.

I think that this may be squid trying to cache something, but had tried to turn all caching off.

My cache.log doesn't really have anything interesting in it that I can see. It's the same ~30 or so log entries each time the service starts, and that is about it. Here it is:

Does anyone see anything I am missing here?


My access.log doesn't really have anything interesting in it either, it just looks like it is working normally. I can attach that too if anyone wants to look at it after I redact some of the hosts.
