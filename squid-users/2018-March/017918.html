<PRE>I had not thought to test that. I will do that today.

In regards to Yuri's comments on firewall vs squid - I don&#8217;t agree that a firewall would be a direct replacement in this case.

The 30-40 URIs I need to access resolve to a potential pool of several million IP addresses, and the pool of IP addresses gets updated multiple times per year. Writing rules at the network level would not be practical to implement even one time, let alone maintain over time. A more expensive firewall that is able to implement ACLs by hostname would be needed, and options for virtual firewalls hosted in Azure are limited. It would also require either implementing many static routes, or a transit network with a virtual router, and this environment will be supported by an organization that does not have a network engineer on staff.

I understand that there is very little functionality I need to leverage, but I like Squid, as it is a name that most people in IT will recognize and be able to google.

I may still review privoxy however. If it is simple enough that supporting it would be something easy to just figure out with minimal research, it may still be a good option. I like simple, but high supportability is mandatory
