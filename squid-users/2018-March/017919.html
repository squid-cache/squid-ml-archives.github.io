&gt;<i> I had not thought to test that. I will do that today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In regards to Yuri's comments on firewall vs squid - I don&#8217;t agree that a firewall would be a direct replacement in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 30-40 URIs I need to access resolve to a potential pool of several million IP addresses, and the pool of IP addresses gets updated multiple times per year. Writing rules at the network level would not be practical to implement even one time, let alone maintain over time. A more expensive firewall that is able to implement ACLs by hostname would be needed, and options for virtual firewalls hosted in Azure are limited. It would also require either implementing many static routes, or a transit network with a virtual router, and this environment will be supported by an organization that does not have a network engineer on staff.
</I>It depends. If your make Internet access for servers due to updates - in
most cases updates has limited distribution points (of course, we're not
considering CDN now). Some cases can be easy solved by server's built-in
firewall.

If we're talking about infrastructure, best solution for updates is
internal updates server (like WSUS), which only have access to Internet
with all security restrictions. You know this better than me ;) Anyway,
centralized patch/updates server behind the border firewall is best
solution.

But this is, of course, abstract discussion.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that there is very little functionality I need to leverage, but I like Squid, as it is a name that most people in IT will recognize and be able to google.
</I>We're like it too, but Squid's itself is big and relatively complex
software, requires much experience to use and not always easy in
support. It has a lot of functions and can have very complex
configurations. This is why I can't recommend use it in all cases
requires proxying/caching without serious reasons.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may still review privoxy however. If it is simple enough that supporting it would be something easy to just figure out with minimal research, it may still be a good option. I like simple, but high supportability is mandatory
</I>Yes. Privoxy is very simple instead Squid. It is non-caching proxy,
which have all functionality you require. It works with hostnames.

Don't worry - you will not require much support for it. It's just works. ;)
