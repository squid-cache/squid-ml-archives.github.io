TLS was designed with periodic key rollout after a time, while SSH was not.
you must take care of it manually, or not atall.

SSH was (apparently) designed with possibility of (semi-)physical access to the
server, so you can verify keys personally.

This is not applicable with TLS, where everyone should be able to
communicate with everyone.

this way SSH is more similar to PGP where users have to exchange their
public keys to be trusted.

(you can get keys from trusted friend which is in fact simmilar to CA).

&gt;&gt;<i> unlike SSL, SSH was not designed to be used globally between everyone,

</I>
the SSL is encrypted end-to-end. Trusted third-party CAs are just way to
avoid the need of everyone going to every company owning a site for the
server keys once in its lifetime (uaually a year).

even CA doesn't see your communication, unless they make the MITM attack
themselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, users is involved in both cases. However the difference still here.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SSH is end-to-end always by design (we're not talking about things like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Kerberos here), TLS is not.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> TLS was designed to be end-to-end encryption and the certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authority
</I>
&gt;<i>As Stanislavsky said, &quot;I do not believe it!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>End-to-end encryption and the (/trusted third-party/) certificate
</I>&gt;<i>authority these are antonyms.
</I>
Well, you can tell this to your clients but the main point - breaking into
users' communication that is supposed to be unbreakable by you - is
something you must explain to your clients and possibly to the lawyers.
