Then Squids behaviour already matches your requirements. The &quot;or when
timeout occurs&quot; is shutdown_lifetime and you do not have to do anything.

Nod. It will also likely be handling CONNECT tunnels for other things.
Be aware that these connections can last indefinitely - some have been
known to last on a timescale of several weeks.

If your maintenance is with squid.conf or things loaded by it use &quot;squid
-k reconfigure&quot; instead of a restart cycle. Squid can reload its config
fine with just a pause for any active clients - your netstat approach
could be useful to pick a time with minimal connections to reload the
config.

Since WebSockets is part of your situation netstat will almost certainly
not work as well as you suspect. These connections can be very
surprising in their lifetimes.

</I>&gt;<i> netstat -nat | grep &quot;.*:443.*:&quot; | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That seems to give me what I want.

Hmm, you might be able to get more useful info from the Squid
filedescriptors report.
  squidclient mgr:filedescriptors


&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible that bad things could happen by stopping Squid when I see

</I>
Should not be any bad things if you just use -k shutdown (twice). Squid
will take the time it needs for a clean (but immediate) shutdown so long
as you only do it twice, not more and do not use &quot;kill&quot; command.
