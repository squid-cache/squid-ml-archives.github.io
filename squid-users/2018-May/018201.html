So in theory it could work if I set the buffer-size low enough, like 16 bytes, so the log line would never fit in the buffer and thus being sent asap?

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;

Thanks for the clarification. Reading &quot;To send each log line as text data to a UDP receiver.&quot; (at <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/access_log/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/access_log/</A> ) made me think that each line would be sent individually without buffering.

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What am I missing here?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want my log to be readable ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW; The UDP module is intended for a logger which is capable of

</I>&gt;<i> at that.
</I>
I see. It will be very handy when we get around to make our own logging/stats engine take the input from Squid like we do with syslog messages from our firewalls. But that is in the future of another project.

&gt;<i> You will probably find sending these to the Squid machines syslog and
</I>&gt;<i> having that relay them out to the remote server in the syslog format
</I>&gt;<i> works better than sending a raw UDP stream.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe using the TCP module and avoiding the complexity of syslog
</I>&gt;<i> entirely.
</I>
Yep, I will go via the syslog on the squid machines. I was trying to remove as many dependencies as possible but I guess syslog is one I can live with since it it required by other services.

Thanks for a quick and very helpful answer.
