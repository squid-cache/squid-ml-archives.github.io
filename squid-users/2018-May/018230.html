Unless you configured Squid SSL-Bump features to be enabled Squid does
not decrypt anything. So it will only be dealing with the HTTP side of
the traffic.

WebSockets is a sub-protocol that operates over HTTP as well as HTTPS.
So the headers are can be available to Squid in un-encrypted traffic -
that is a client software choice. If HTTP is used Squid lack of support
for HTTP/1.1 Upgrade is in effect.

A client that properly follows the WebSocket protocol should have
several fallback connection types it can use instead of HTTP through the
proxy. Those choices include native WebSockets protocol on a non-HTTP(S)
port, or continuing to use HTTP messaging (working) instead of WebSocket
(not working).


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw several topics regard this issue, but didn't really understand the
</I>&gt;<i> problem. If someone set a squid proxy with SSL bump, how is it even possible
</I>&gt;<i> that squid blocks it?
</I>
If SSL-Bump is configured, Squid decrypts the TLS layer. Exposing the
fact that the supposedly &quot;HTTPS&quot; tunnel actually contains WebSocket
protocol instead of HTTP(S). Since WebSocket and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade to
start it is not supported by Squid one of two things happen;
 a) the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header (if any) gets removed when the request
is relayed to the server, or
 b) WebSocket native protocol has Squid on_unsupported_protocol action
performed - if your Squid is one of the older version that lack that
directive the connection just gets rejected.


&gt;<i> I tried to use squid locally on my computer and it
</I>&gt;<i> looks that those headers passed just fine (connection initiated correctly),
</I>&gt;<i> so why is it mentioned that those headers are not supported?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
They should not have been relayed. If properly working the Upgrade
header should be listed in the Connection: header which causes it to be
removed by Squid (or any other middleware without Upgrade:WebSocket
support) on the purely HTTP(S) traffic sent to servers.

I suspect you omitted that mandatory Connection:Upgrade header in your test.
