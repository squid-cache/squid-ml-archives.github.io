Yes, that is exactly what is happening.


* When intercepting HTTP (port 80) traffic the protocol is HTTP. Squid
is receiving messages generated by the client *naming* the server it
wants to connect with, OR with just a raw-IP if client wants to do it
that way.

* When handling explicit proxy (port 3128) traffic the protocol is HTTP.
Squid is receiving CONNECT messages generated by the client again
*naming* the server it wants to connect with, OR with just a raw-IP if
client wants to do it that way.

* When intercepting HTTPS (port 443) traffic the protocol is initially
just TCP. Squid is receiving TCP SYN packet and fakes/generates a
CONNECT message to represent this opaque connection (ie. CONNECT to a
raw-IP).

If (and only if) a CONNECT is itself allowed into the proxy does
SSL-Bump begin for the TLS wrapped inside that message. That goes for
both types of CONNECT message - Squid or client generated.

It should be obvious from the above why you see different behaviour for
the two methods of using the proxy.



&gt;<i> But this is ONLY for the &quot;windows_boxes&quot;, for everything else it's working as it should.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what's going on here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
If the fake CONNECT with raw-IP at SSL-Bump step1 is not allowed to go
through the proxy then the TLS handshake cannot even start to happen. So
there will never be a ssl::server_name for the whitelist ACL to match.

Now that you have altered localnet to exclude the *.201 and *.202 IPs
the &quot;allow localnet&quot; is no longer permitting them to use the proxy.
  AND the whitelist ACL is still not matching the raw-IPs which occur in
CONNECT messages. Which leaves Squid with &quot;deny all&quot;.
