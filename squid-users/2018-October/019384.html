That does not sound right to me. OpenWRT is a Linux based operating
system. The security model in Linux systems is to *not* run processes as
root user unless absolutely necessary.

The Squid master process is started *by* root because it must be
assigned some SUID privileges to special network sockets and to
sub-assign regular privileges to the worker and helper processes that do
the actual networking I/O stuff.


&gt;<i> And external acl-helpers will not work, when started as nobody and trying to

</I>&gt;<i> Any answer to the original question ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The Squid worker and helper processes handle raw I/O from remote network
locations which cannot be trusted. It is extremely unsafe to run any
process handling such I/O with root level privileges.

Helpers do not have to be started as &quot;nobody&quot;. They can be run as any
low-privilege account. &quot;root&quot; account is not low-privilege enough.

So the simple answer to your question is &quot;no&quot;. But your problem may not
be what you think it is. Is there anything you can provide about any
error you are seeing when starting Squid?
