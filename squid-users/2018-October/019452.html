Yes, Squid behaves differently when configured differently.

* My original response was specific to SslBump-enabled Squid ports.
Today, those configurations assume that the admin wants to bump CONNECTs
on errors (and has given Squid the certificate to enable such bumping).

* For SslBump-disabled ports (which is the default), Squid has no choice
but to deny/redirect the CONNECT request itself. Denied/redirected
CONNECT requests are mishandled by popular browsers -- Squid denial
errors are not shown to the user, and redirects are not followed.

Please note that the difference is not in matching ssl_bump actions, but
in whether the corresponding http_port was configured to use SslBump. In
the former case, whether the ssl_bump rules are checked depends on the
SslBump step where the CONNECT request is denied/redirected. In the
second/default case, ssl_bump rules are never checked.


If you prefer non-SslBump behavior, you should use it, of course! Some
admins find that browser-generated errors are insufficiently detailed
and/or produce more support queries than Squid-generated errors. YMMV.

If you want to change SslBump behavior when denying or redirecting
CONNECT requests, please make a specific proposal, keeping in mind that
many existing Squid deployments depend on Squid error pages being
displayed to the user (and/or on Squid redirects followed). Your
proposal will need to either convince folks that the existing behavior
should change or add options to optionally enable some new behavior.

Alex.
