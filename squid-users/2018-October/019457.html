I was intending to keep this between the admin already working on the
issues. But maybe I should explain a few details that I uncovered in the
last few days.


There is something about the way you (morteza) are posting messages to
the mailing list which is causing a bunch of spam to be delivered along
with each of your emails - often this spam arrives first by 1-2 seconds.

These spam are clearly forging the same message-ID your emails use to
*uniquely* identify themselves. As a result it takes longer for your
real message to reach the list. The system has to detect and erase the
spam messages before your message is accepted as having a unique ID from
the leftover emails Yahoo is trying to deliver.

Another side-effect is that our servers rejecting the burst of spam
causes the Yahoo system to become extra suspicious of our servers for a
while. During that time Yahoo is either delaying or rejecting emails
which we are trying to deliver to you and other Yahoo users. That
includes your own request going back out.

So if the person who might have answered your question immediately
happened to be one of those Yahoo users - they are not going to receive
your message for many hours, maybe a whole day. Or sometimes never at all.

If one of us non-Yahoo users do receive it happen to reply quickly
during that slowdown period our message may take hours/days to reach
you, or be rejected entirely by Yahoo and you never see it.
Unfortunately the length of this time is not easily known, and also gets
restarted each time this situation happens.


I hope this clarifies what is going on here. I know the problem is
probably not your fault, but there are some things you can do to help
everyone have a better time communicating. Like, tweak your mailer
settings. Not use the web UI at all if you can. Patience, etc.

Is it probably a good idea also to get your computing device checked for
virus etc infections. I'm not sure how the spam gets your message-ID
value, but the timing of it is a bit suspicious to me.
