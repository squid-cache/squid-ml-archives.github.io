&gt;&gt;<i> ... until the browser starts using DNS over HTTPS (with a pinned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate of the &quot;resolving&quot; HTTPS server)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; Alex.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is relatively easy to block DNS over HTTPS and I think there will 
</I>&gt;<i> be demand for that.
</I>&gt;<i> And I predict that Squid will have a feature to selectively block 
</I>&gt;<i> connections with ESNI to force clients to use the plain text SNI.

I can still see the endpoint security companies will be raking it in. 
Any of those fallbacks could be disabled by the browsers.

We're going to have to make sure that the endpoint solution is able to 
see all content before it is rendered or interpreted in the browser too.

The problem is that the whole SSL/TLS trust management system is 
fundamentally broken and I can't see that changing soon. PGP's model was 
great in theory (web of trust) but most people simply don't care who 
sends them what and can't be bothered to complicate their lives any 
more. And why should they? If their bank site works, Farcebook works and 
Hotmail works, why worry? We've built an entire social structure on two 
basic principles - &quot;if I've done nothing wrong...&quot; and &quot;who'd be 
interested in my data?&quot;.
