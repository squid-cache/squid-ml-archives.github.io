Please upgrade to Squid-4.2 ASAP. All 4.0.* releases are beta code and
no longer supported.

Recent as it was there are already several rather major fixes to the
SSL-Bump code since that version. I don't think the upgrade will solve
this particular problem (but it may do if we are lucky) and those other
issues need to be avoided.
