Good.  Well done.

That won't work.

Indeed.

&gt;<i> My question is does SSL work with CA signed certificate?
</I>
SSL?  Yes.

SSL Bump / interception, no - because if it did, you'd have a globally-trusted 
certificate which you could use to fake any website on the Internet.

Security?  The CA who gave you that certificate would disappear.
