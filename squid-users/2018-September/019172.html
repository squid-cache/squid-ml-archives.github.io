I don't have a recipe for it, but I'd thought that since Squid can create a 
certificate on demand, Apache or NGinx would be able to too.

If that's not feasible, though...

&gt;<i> &quot;2. a pile of SSL certificates which you generate using your own CA at the

</I>&gt;<i> domains you're putting into your &quot;DNS sinkhole&quot;, so just generate an SSL

</I>&gt;<i> there you go. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not really feasible because the lists are always being updated.
</I>
So?  Update the certificates at the same time as DNS.  It'll be a lot less work 
for your web server, too, just having to use a pre-existing certificate to 
service a request, rather than having to generate a certificate every time it 
sees the first request for a domain.

&gt;<i> I could write a script or something but I think it would be better just to
</I>&gt;<i> have a web server or proxy create the certificates when the client tries to
</I>&gt;<i> connect.
</I>
Agreed, but just in case it's not feasible, a script to generate SSL certs 
from your DNS list certainly would be.

Either way, I don't see that Squid's MITM SSL Bump facility is a solution, 
because as I said previously, you have no connection to be in the middle of.
