<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; So, in a brief the confi is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ssl_bump peek step1 all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ssl_bump peek step2 noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ssl_bump stare step2 all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... which should be equivalent to an even simpler config:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step1 
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump stare all
</I>
Yes, i've tested and squid log shows the same. So,it appears that squid takes the same actions.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... which, for many reasonable definitions of noBumpSites (that match during
</I>&gt;<i> step1 if and only if they should match during step1), can be simplified even
</I>&gt;<i> further:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump stare all
</I>
Same as above, this &quot;compact&quot; config seems to be the same as the three above bump ruleset.

Please, let me know if I understand why those cfg are equals or equivalent to config I've posted as a &quot;final one&quot;.

First alternative difference:

&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step1  # implicit &quot;all&quot; at step1
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek noBumpSites # As there no step specified, squid match at any step then this line, match at step1 and then at step2 , so when a match occurs at step2 it precludes future bumping of the sites listed in the ACL.
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump stare all # Here there is either no step2 (and any step) specified but, because in the previous line You has (implicitly) peeked at step2, the stare'ing not (or can&#180;t) applies to sites listed in ACL (they were peeked at step2).
</I>
Second alternative difference:

&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek noBumpSites # Like previous example, but..I guess that as there is no &quot;all&quot; explicit, this line do a &quot;peek all at step1&quot; (implicitly) and at step2 sites listed in ACL are being peek'd. To clarify, if I would add an &quot;all&quot; at the end of this line, then all traffic would be spliced.
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump stare all # There is no change between this line in both configs you've posted, So my &quot;explanation&quot; would be the same as of the &quot;First alternative&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i> However, please note that the three configs above implicitly rely on Squid
</I>&gt;<i> splicing (or bumping) at step3 because of the previously matching
</I>&gt;<i> step2 peek (or stare) action and the lack of an explicit step3 rule.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether Squid v4.2 actually does what it should be doing, I do not know.
</I>
Answered; squid &quot;automagic &quot; are working as spected. (Squid Cache: Version 4.2-20180902-r6d8f397)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1: Is this peek-n-splice ruleset insecure?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Define &quot;secure&quot;.
</I>
Well, is not the same if there is a squid-TLS (in the LAN) between a client and sensitive external server when a TLS connection is being established as if there is nothing between they.

In this sense I would like to know how could I interference as less as possible with the squid in the middle when someone is accesing to a site that I wish not to bump.
Or let the less quantity of security holes as possible.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2: It is correct to say that those lines are not necessary/redundant?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They should be redundant, but I do not know whether Squid v4.2
</I>&gt;<i> implements this aspect of the specs correctly. I know that there were related
</I>&gt;<i> implementation bugs in some Squid v3 releases. You can test and, if needed,
</I>&gt;<i> file a bug report.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (#ssl_bump splice step3 noBumpSites/#ssl_bump bump step3 all)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that the meaning of your noBumpSites ACL changes from one
</I>&gt;<i> step to another (because it gets more/different info). Thus, it is incorrect to
</I>&gt;<i> say that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step1
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step2 noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump splice step3 noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is always exactly equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step1
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump peek step2 noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i>   ssl_bump splice step3 all # should be optional
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When using the first configuration, it is possible that, in some specific case,
</I>&gt;<i> noBumpSites matches during step2 but does not match during step3, and
</I>&gt;<i> Squid proceeds to evaluating the remaining &quot;...&quot; rules in that specific case.
</I>&gt;<i> Such sequence of events is not possible in the second configuration because
</I>&gt;<i> splicing at step3 is unconditional there -- it does not rely on noBumpSites
</I>&gt;<i> matches during step3.
</I>
OK, thanks to clarify that.

Last question.

When I do this:

ssl_bump splice noBumpSites
ssl_bump stare all

It is supposed that in this config I am (guessing), implicity, peeking  (first?) and splice at any step and bumping (implicity) at step3 sites that does not match with whitelist by staring at step2. Maybe something like that, I dont know.

The thin is that I see in the logs a tunnel but, instead an IP address it shows a domain. (TCP_TUNNEL www.dropbox.com:433) *and* a security ALERT. Saying that there is no IP that match with the xyz.net domain, or some like that.

So, taking into account the needs that I have already mentioned, what is the way I should take?

&gt;<i> HTH,
</I>
Always helps.

Thank You!
 
&gt;<i> Alex.
