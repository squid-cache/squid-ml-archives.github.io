<PRE>I reply to myself due to a bounce and I have to re-enable the membership to list at least 3 times at month. 
Maybe a problem with Yahoo.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Alex: After a splice rule is applied, SslBump is over. No  more rules are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> checked. No more loops are iterated. Squid simply &quot;exits&quot; the  SslBump
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feature (and becomes a TCP tunnel).
</I>
OK, that is what makes me a noise, and therefore I asked about what you said.

&gt;&gt;<i> What about the meaning of the ACL's at step1 when splice?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* If the splice rule ACLs match, the splice rule is applied. In that
</I>&gt;<i>case you can consult my statement above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* If the splice rule ACLs do not match, then the splice rule is not
</I>&gt;<i>applied. My statement above explicitly does not cover this case -- it
</I>&gt;<i>starts with &quot;after a splice rule is APPLIED&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> e.g.:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There only these two rules for ssl_bump statements:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ssl_bump splice sitesAB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ssl_bump splice SitesCD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess that here, Squid has to do 2 loops at outer/main loop to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evaluate step1 twice, due to rules differs (sitesAB and sitesCD ACL)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and see if both match to splice.
</I>
I think that I made a mistake in above sentence. 
I have should said &quot;(..) Squid has to do 2 loops at inner while he is at the main loop (at SslBump1)&quot;

&gt;<i>I do not know why you are guessing instead of carefully applying the
</I>&gt;<i>already documented procedure, but you guessed wrong. At any step, the
</I>&gt;<i>first matching rule is applied. For example, if sitesAB matches, then
</I>&gt;<i>Squid splices without checking the second (i.e. SitesCD) rule.
</I>
Well, I am guessing because many things are not completely clear to me and/or easy to understand, at all. I am new in TLS filtering.
For example I never would think that in the given example, the second rule (sitesCD) will not never be checked later.
I asked or write that example with the inner loop in mind; I'm sorry.

&gt;&gt;<i> Are You (perhaps) talking about the examples in the thread and not what happens &quot;in general&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My statements above are general except the &quot;For example...&quot; sentence
</I>&gt;<i>that refers to your specific example.
</I>
Its good to know.

&gt;&gt;<i> In which case the &quot;noBumpSites&quot; ACL could have not match? I mean if I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell a Squid: &quot;splice at step1 this.site.net&quot; How that matches can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Roughly speaking, the server_name ACL matches at step1 when the real or
</I>&gt;<i>fake CONNECT Host information match one of the configured server names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For example, if you are intercepting or if the real CONNECT request
</I>&gt;<i>contains an IP address (rather than a host name), then the server_name
</I>&gt;<i>ACL matches if the reverse DNS lookup for that IP address is successful
</I>&gt;<i>and matches at least one of the configured server names. In other cases,
</I>&gt;<i>the ACL does not match during step1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The reality is more complex than the above rough summary because domain
</I>&gt;<i>name comparison is a complex algorithm. Consult the latest Squid
</I>&gt;<i>documentation for details. Also, please do not forget that step2
</I>&gt;<i>matching adds checking TLS client SNI name, and step3 matching adds
</I>&gt;<i>checking certificate Subject names. It gets really complex...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For example, the Host header of a CONNECT request may not be the same as
</I>&gt;<i>the TLS client-supplied SNI name, and/or the server certificate subject
</I>&gt;<i>name may. These differences (and other random factors like DNS
</I>&gt;<i>inconsistencies) may result in the server_name ACL match result changes
</I>&gt;<i>across the steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Modern Squids have additional server_name options that control some of
</I>&gt;<i>the matching nuances discussed above.
</I>
That's what I imagined you meant (and worried too) -without any kind of knowledge-. And now you have just confirmed it. 
So things become a little more delicate. 
And *now* I understand why you have done so much emphasis saying: &quot;If the rule match...&quot;

&gt;<i>Alex.
</I>
Thank You.
