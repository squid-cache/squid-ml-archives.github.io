I do not know what &quot;implicitly match&quot; means here, but yes, the splice
rule may only match at step2 in this configuration:

* It cannot match at step1 because the earlier &quot;peek&quot; rule matches at step1.

* It is always reached during step2 because no rules above it can match
during step2. Whether it matches during step2 depends on whether
noBumpSites matches a particular transaction during step2.

* It cannot match at step3 because for a splice rule to match at step3 a
peek rule has to match at step2, and there is no peek rule that can
match at step2 in your configuration.


&gt;<i> However as I said above if the splice is the first rule instead the

</I>
Naturally. If you place the splice rule first, it may match during step1
as well. If you do not, it cannot.


&gt;&gt;<i> After a splice rule is applied, SslBump is over. No  more rules are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checked. No more loops are iterated. Squid simply &quot;exits&quot; the  SslBump 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature (and becomes a TCP tunnel).

&gt;<i> Here, probably (not sure) Alex rerefered here to &quot;splice all&quot; rule.
</I>
I think you are ignoring or misinterpreting the verb &quot;applied&quot;. Here,
&quot;applied&quot; means Squid has executed the rule action. Not just considered
the rule containing that action, but actually ran that action. Applying
a rule action implies that the rule ACLs (whatever they were) matched,
of course. A rule action is never applied when the rule ACLs do not match.


&gt;<i> In that case is clear &quot;splice is a final action&quot; then no more future checks.
</I>
The notion of a &quot;final&quot; action does not depend on rule ACLs. After Squid
applies the &quot;splice&quot; action (in whatever context, for whatever reason),
SslBump processing for that transaction is over. Same for &quot;bump&quot; and
&quot;terminate&quot; actions.


&gt;<i> But in my config next to splice there is an ACL. That is why I asked: &quot;But, doesn't the ACL matters?&quot; in earlier mail.
</I>
ACLs (and other things) determine which rules match. After a rule
matches, then Squid applies its action, and then the notion of a &quot;final
action&quot; starts to matter.


&gt;<i> Will Squid ignore the last rule?
</I>
No. The last rule will be applied at step2 whenever noBumpSites
mismatches at step2.


HTH,

Alex.
