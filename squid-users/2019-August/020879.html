Since this is a reverse-proxy it really should be listening on port 443
unless you have a good reason not to.

Do all these backend systems accept URLs of the form:
  <A HREF="https://imageuploadqa.com:8443/...">https://imageuploadqa.com:8443/...</A>

FYI: One of the major benefits of reverse-proxy is that they can protect
against garbage traffic for bogus domains etc aimed at your domain. The
no-vhost style config disables that protection completely.
 No matter what URL anyone sends to this proxy it will automatically
force re-write with that <A HREF="scheme://domain:port/">scheme://domain:port/</A> string before any
internal services and even Squids own ACLs get to see the traffic.

</I>
Please remove that DONT_VERIFY_PEER. It is highly dangerous and actually
not useful.

Just add the sslcafile= option with a PEM file containing the CA(s)
which issued that peers X.509 certificate.

</I>
That is a very strong hint that the problem is DNS related.

Check both A and AAAA are resolving without a timeout or SERVFAIL
result. That the IP(s) produced are all able to be connected to by the
proxy machine OR connection attempts get a quick non-routable ICMP error
back.


&gt;<i> adaptation_access service_avi_req allow all

</I>
Very Odd. All that line is doing is making it clear to you what the
behaviour is for that peer.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if am missing any configuration&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Please explain &quot;not working&quot; in more detail - what do you see happening
exactly?

Is it;
 * failing to connect?
 * - does the domain name resolve properly when looked up by your Squid?
 * failing to send the ICAP request?
 * failing to get a response?
 * failing to deliver the response it gets?
 * is any of those a timeout or an explicit error seen by Squid?
 * is Squid producing any error message explaining the problem?
 * are there any hints in cache.log?


Lots of details please.
