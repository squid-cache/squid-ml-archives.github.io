Yes, look for &quot;client certificate&quot; in your squid.conf.documented.

</I>
If you are implying that Squid would check whether the client has sent a
particular client certificate copy, then this is not how certificate
authentication works. Squid would validate whether the client has sent a
certificate _signed_ by the configured client CA certificate. A single
CA certificate can be used to sign (i.e. issue) millions of client
certificates.


&gt;<i> I'm wonder if the proxy can ask for the client certificate and

</I>
It is possible in theory but Squid cannot do that. There could be some
very special environments where such a scheme would make sense, but keep
in mind that the server would have to share its client CA certificate
(or equivalent) with Squid for the scheme to work.


&gt;<i> I understand in the current timeline, the proxy is
</I>&gt;<i> negotiate with the server before accepting the tls hello from client.
</I>
In most SslBump setups, Squid negotiates with the server _after_ seeing
the TLS client Hello.
