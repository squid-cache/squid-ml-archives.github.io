</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that squid does some security checking that the SNI of an

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection.  Or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not being able to say precisely what Squid is actually doing shows that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The security check you are posting about has many secondary consequences
</I>&gt;<i> and side effects to be taken into account. Quite a few people have taken
</I>&gt;<i> a stab at solving these rejections and what we have in Squid right now
</I>&gt;<i> is the best that can be done without significant redesign work (which is
</I>&gt;<i> underway - just very slowly, help welcome).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is why we have the squid-dev mailing list for code change
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. If you want to actually help solving false-positives in this
</I>&gt;<i> security check please post there and we who have been working on this
</I>&gt;<i> issue for 10+ years now can discuss what we know about the situation,
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;gotcha&quot; side effects we have to avoid and ideas for improvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However with the prevalence of CDNs and badly configured DNSs and geographic 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DNSs, this breaks lots of connections (eg, I can't watch the NHL).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I run Squid on a trusted network and use it primarily for caching and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logging, and so I while I need to run WCCP for some non-proxy capable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; devices, I don't need that security check.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without that check you cannot call your network a &quot;secure network&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> anymore. The absence of the check opens a nest of security holes for
</I>&gt;<i> attackers to walk right in past all those other protections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It stops all of those 409 errors occurring.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because of that I've created some patches that add a new option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;host_verify_strict_intercepted&quot; which is off by default.  They are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for Squid 4.9.  As this is disabling a security feature of Squid do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not apply this patch unless you are prepared for any and all consequences.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not spread this around. People who want to really insist on
</I>&gt;<i> allowing virus/malware to spread unchecked around their networks can
</I>&gt;<i> make smaller patches.

</I>Hi Amos,

sorry for posting in the wrong forum.  While you're here: I've seen a handful 
of posts about the 409s and the response has been &quot;security&quot;.  Fair enough.  

Can you please provide a concrete example of

a) why host_verify_strict is available as a toggle for non-intercepted 
requests, and
b) why intercepted requests don't have this option at all?

I'm suffering from a lack of imagination and I've yet to see any example 
given (and ok, I may have missed one somewhere) and would like one brought to 
my (and other reader's) attention.

Thanks,
Scott
