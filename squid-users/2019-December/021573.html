Lets start with some of the basics:

TLS has the concept of a &quot;proxy cert&quot; - that is a certificate with a
flag stating that the server type is a proxy. That makes modifications
to how things like SNI, same-origin protections and nested encryption
are handled in clients. The traffic inside the TLS is the same as you
would see on port 3128 - its just encrypted now.


The &quot;cert you put in the proxy&quot; for SSL-Bump should be a CA cert. Either
a root/self-signed or intermediate CA cert. That type of cert can sign
other certs. SSL-Bump generates the 'modified host cert' and needs a CA
to sign it. The client thinks it is talking to an origin server - the
traffic inside the TLS is usually the same as you would see on port 80.


I hope that makes the situation(s) clear? (I am simplifying a few
things. But they should not matter to the basic understanding.)

If you are looking to view the cert the proxy has been _configured with_
on an ssl-bump port that 'cert' is the *entire chain* of CAs following
the server cert you called the &quot;modified host cert&quot;. Some will have been
loaded through 'cert=' and some maybe loaded through other directives
(eg cafile or capath).
