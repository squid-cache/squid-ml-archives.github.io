<PRE>Thanks, I appreciate your detailed answer.

 &gt; &gt; I'm struggling a lot to configure Squid. To improve the security of my app in my AWS private subnet,
 &gt; 
 &gt; If it is indeed *your* app; then please alter it not to require the
 &gt; interception we see below. Ability to connect to a TLS explicit proxy or
 &gt; just sending regular proxy CONNECT tunnel is a leap up in security.

I wish I could too ! Unfortunately, we use some third party libraries that do not support proxies (or not well). What a shame : (
 
 &gt; &gt; # Hide some reavealing or useless headers
 &gt; &gt; forwarded_for delete
 &gt; &gt; httpd_suppress_version_string off
 &gt; &gt; reply_header_access X-Cache deny all
 &gt; &gt; reply_header_access X-Cache-Lookup deny all
 &gt; &gt; via off
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Tuning
 &gt; &gt; max_filedesc 10000
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Disable access to manager
 &gt; &gt; http_access deny manager
 &gt; 
 &gt; 2) you are missing the security protections from the default squid.conf...
 
I have not hardened Squid yet, but you mean default `acl localnet src [...]` rules ? I'm not sure about this.

 &gt; Please see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>&gt; for
 &gt; details on the TLS handshake process and what SSL-Bump does during that.

Another read was indeed interesting, I think I corrected ssl_bump directives. However I still can't make it work.
Just for the record, I would like to block everything but some HTTPS websites for particular URLs. The ssl::server_name acl is not enough for me, I would like to use url_regex or similar.
Ant that's where it gets wrong, I can't make Squid make the link between `ssl_bump bump` and url_regex.

 &gt; &gt; Should I use squid 4 for this ?
 &gt; 
 &gt; TL;DR : Yes.
 
I did that, thanks !
Easy to install and migrate on arch but I think I will need to compile it for Amazon Linux.

 &gt; interception we see below. Ability to connect to a TLS explicit proxy or
 &gt; just sending regular proxy CONNECT tunnel is a leap up in security.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; I would like to build a HTTPS proxy to whitelist *only* some URLs.
 &gt; &gt; My wish is to *not* rely on SNI filtering but bump HTTPS traffic in order to filter the URLs (path) of HTTPS requests. I know that means to install a custom CA.
 &gt; &gt; The thing is... I have a hard compiling a working configuration file for Squid 3.5, most examples are outdated or incomplete.
 &gt; 
 &gt; It looks below like you are of the mistaken belief that &quot;HTTPS requests&quot;
 &gt; are actually a distinct thing that can be manipulated and tested.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &quot;HTTPS&quot; is just a moniker used to describe a multi-layer system for
 &gt; delivering HTTP messages securely. This has a major impact on what can
 &gt; be done at any particular time, especially regarding the URLs from those
 &gt; HTTP messages.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; My current config is :
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # ---
 &gt; &gt; # General
 &gt; &gt; cache_effective_user squid
 &gt; &gt; cache_effective_group squid
 &gt; &gt; shutdown_lifetime 1 seconds 
 &gt; &gt; visible_hostname squid
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Note 1) 'squid' is not a unique hostname. Ideally it should be a FQDN.
 &gt; At the very least an internally resolvable name so the URLs Squid
 &gt; generates with this string as the domain name will be valid for clients
 &gt; needing to download objects with those URLs from Squid. Either way it
 &gt; has to be unique across all proxies the traffic *might* travel -
 &gt; otherwise the messages will be dropped in transit. So definitely do not
 &gt; use something this simple and often-repeated as &quot;squid&quot; or &quot;proxy&quot;.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Hide some reavealing or useless headers
 &gt; &gt; forwarded_for delete
 &gt; &gt; httpd_suppress_version_string off
 &gt; &gt; reply_header_access X-Cache deny all
 &gt; &gt; reply_header_access X-Cache-Lookup deny all
 &gt; &gt; via off
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Tuning
 &gt; &gt; max_filedesc 10000
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Disable access to manager
 &gt; &gt; http_access deny manager
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; 2) you are missing the security protections from the default squid.conf...
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Handling HTTPS requests
 &gt; &gt; https_port 8080 ssl-bump generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB cert=/etc/squid/ssl/squid.pem options=NO_SSLv3,NO_TLSv1,NO_TLSv1_1,SINGLE_DH_USE,SINGLE_ECDH_USE intercept
 &gt; &gt; sslcrtd_program /usr/lib64/squid/ssl_crtd -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB
 &gt; &gt; sslcrtd_children 8 startup=1 idle=1
 &gt; &gt; acl SSL_port port 443
 &gt; &gt; http_access allow SSL_port
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; 3) Not a good idea. I see a lot of admin get this far and stop looking
 &gt; for the proper solution when &quot;things work&quot;.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Since you are intercepting traffic to reach this point it should be
 &gt; somewhat reasonable to limit the allowed traffic to some IP range. eg.
 &gt; the subnet of IPs you are intercepting and sending into the proxy.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Whitelist
 &gt; &gt; acl whitelist-regex url_regex -i thirdparty.com/upload/stuff/
 &gt; &gt; acl whitelist-regex url_regex -i otherthirdparty.com/specific-path/
 &gt; &gt; http_access allow whitelist-regex
 &gt; 
 &gt; Okay.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # SSL bump
 &gt; &gt; acl step1 at_step SslBump1
 &gt; &gt; ssl_bump peek step1
 &gt; 
 &gt;  ... if the client is allowed to connect to the proxy, fetch its
 &gt; clientHello details...
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; ssl_bump bump whitelist-regex
 &gt; 
 &gt; ... then try to do the impossible. We only have TLS details at this
 &gt; point. There is no HTTP message - therefore no URL to match against.
 &gt;  -&gt; result: skip this line, never do this &quot;bump&quot; action.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; ssl_bump terminate step2 !whitelist-regex
 &gt; 
 &gt; ... regex still cannot match.
 &gt; ... but a non-match (aka false) with '!' means true.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So at step2 always terminate the connection.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Notice how there has still not been anything even remotely HTTP from the
 &gt; client/app and they are now disconnected.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; # Deny the rest
 &gt; &gt; http_access deny all
 &gt; &gt; # --- 
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; What I am missing ?
 &gt; 
 &gt; It seems understanding of what ssl_bump is doing is lacking.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Please see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>&gt; for
 &gt; details on the TLS handshake process and what SSL-Bump does during that.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Should I use squid 4 for this ?
 &gt; 
 &gt; TL;DR : Yes.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Long version:
 &gt; 
 &gt; TLS is a volatile environment these days and each Squid release has
 &gt; large improvements to cope with that change. You will find that v4 works
 &gt; okay in a lot of TLS situations where v3 would the throwing up errors
 &gt; and needing extra config workarounds.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also, v3.x are all officially deprecated / no longer supported. v4 is
 &gt; the current stable release.
