<PRE>The test box I set up outside the F5 finally started exhibiting these errors, once I pointed roughly 60 machines to it. It took a few hours. Sounds like this narrows it down to either the OS itself (seems unlikely, other apps would crash), or the litany of agents our security folks have mandated. It may indeed be necessary to move to Linux.

Thank you very much for your time!

No that is not what I meant.

The port Squid has already opened and used syscall listen(2) on is what is being closed (or its address corrupted) outside of Squid. That should only ever be closed by Squid itself. Thus the error.

It is being closed repeatedly. Thus the abort/shutdown. This is not a crash, it is intentional shutdown by Squid due to these fatal
(non-recoverable) errors.

Notice how the error from the OS &quot;(14) Bad Address&quot; is the same. This is just another display of the same problem. Maybe the poll() layer reporting the exact same error as Squid tries to recover. Maybe for other non-listener ports also being corrupted somehow.

If non-listener ports are having that same error it would be a sign the machine memory is being corrupted rather than other software touching the listener ports specifically.


( The details you have provided so far have no hints about where the problem may be coming from, and I am not having any ideas about possibilities either. I just hope the above explanation of meaning can help you think of things to look at for more hints on this very weird issue. )
