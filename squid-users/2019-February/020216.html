That line syntax is &quot;decide: X because Y&quot;

'do not cache but share' means the reply may still be shared with other
concurrent clients (eg. collapsed forwarding), but not to bother trying
to cache it.

'entry has been released' means something else already caused the disk
copy in cache to be removed or replaced.
