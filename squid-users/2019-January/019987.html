Besides what Alex has answered to your first question. I think the
simpler approach would be the second, and probably more what you need
anyway...

 tls_outgoing_options default-ca=off cafile=X.pem cafile=Y.pem


That makes Squid outgoing connections *not* use the global Trusted CA
set. Then explicitly load the individual one(s) you *do* want to trust.

A whitelist - but only for the root / self-signed CA certs. Intermediary
CAs inherit their trust (or lack) from their root CA.

If intermediary CA trust matters to your situation then a custom
validator as mentioned by Alex would be necessary.

NP: You can list cafile=... as many times as you wish to load multiple
files and should be able to load multiple CA certs in any of the
file(s). But have not confirmed that latter.

cache_peer has matching options with &quot;tls-&quot; prefix.
