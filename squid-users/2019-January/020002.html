It sounds like you misunderstood my questions. I will detail them below.

I suspect that fff...fff comes from %&gt;A (whether that %code comes from
the default url_rewrite_extras in your configuration is unimportant).

%&gt;A is documented to to be a client FQDN. I am not sure, and this is not
documented, but perhaps when the client IP address does not point back
to a domain name, %&gt;A should be a client IP address.

For intermediate certificate downloading transactions, Squid does not
have a client address because those transactions are not initiated by a
client connection to Squid. They are generated internally by Squid. In
such cases, Squid should be sending a dash (-), not 127.0.0.1, not
fff...fff, not localhost, and not anything else that might be
misinterpreted as a client IP address or domain name.

I have not investigated why Squid does not send a dash, or what it would
take to fix Squid, but it is likely that this will be eventually fixed
because lying about client address is a bug. To plan the deployment of
that future fix, it may be useful to know whether the redirector you use
handles a dash value for %&gt;A correctly. You may be able to test that by
configuring url_rewrite_extras explicitly and replacing %&gt;A with a dash.

Alex.
