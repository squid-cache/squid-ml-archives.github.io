<PRE>22.01.2019 19:51, Alex Rousskov &#1087;&#1080;&#1096;&#1077;&#1090;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you misunderstood my questions. I will detail them below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that fff...fff comes from %&gt;A (whether that %code comes from
</I>&gt;<i> the default url_rewrite_extras in your configuration is unimportant).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> %&gt;A is documented to to be a client FQDN. I am not sure, and this is not
</I>&gt;<i> documented, but perhaps when the client IP address does not point back
</I>&gt;<i> to a domain name, %&gt;A should be a client IP address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For intermediate certificate downloading transactions, Squid does not
</I>&gt;<i> have a client address because those transactions are not initiated by a
</I>&gt;<i> client connection to Squid. They are generated internally by Squid. In
</I>&gt;<i> such cases, Squid should be sending a dash (-), not 127.0.0.1, not
</I>&gt;<i> fff...fff, not localhost, and not anything else that might be
</I>&gt;<i> misinterpreted as a client IP address or domain name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not investigated why Squid does not send a dash, or what it would
</I>&gt;<i> take to fix Squid, but it is likely that this will be eventually fixed
</I>&gt;<i> because lying about client address is a bug. To plan the deployment of
</I>&gt;<i> that future fix, it may be useful to know whether the redirector you use
</I>&gt;<i> handles a dash value for %&gt;A correctly. You may be able to test that by
</I>&gt;<i> configuring url_rewrite_extras explicitly and replacing %&gt;A with a dash.
</I>

Thank you for explanation, it is easier for me to contact rejik 
developer and ask him to pass traffic if client address is &quot;-&quot; as he 
already did for

fff...fff.  So, I'll inform him that such change is planned and he will be ready :-)

Thank you!
