<PRE>Amos,

Thanks for the feedback.

Now that we write about the subject in clear text it's making things a bit clear.
I wasn't sure about the  purpose of the helpers to begin with.

As you wrote before, for specific use cases these X.509 properties are what this specific organization need to verify.
&gt;<i>From my point of view most users(non-technical) are yet to understand these properties good enough and these are things
</I>that us and our kids needs to learn about the Internet: &quot;not every Encrypted traffic means secure!&quot;.

Specifically Let's encrypt makes sure that the world of encryption will be more popular and there for more secure.
So +*2 for them but still the point stays with then that encryption might not always be the right way.
SFTP ,MS and OpenSSL + others proved that encryption is a must in our world but not always the right answer.

..Also DNSSec and/or EDNS makes this picture much clear.

Eliezer

* If I missed someone it's because there are too many to say thank you to/for.

</I>&gt;<i> Compared to this there are couple other level's of Certificates like what is name &quot;EV&quot; (the one of banks and such critical ORG's).
</I>&gt;<i> Let's encrypt brings to domain ownership the ability to being verified as the domain owner or it's proxy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Root CA that the bank of America uses has the license to offer not only encryption but also:
</I>&gt;<i> * Ensures the identity of a remote computer
</I>&gt;<i> * Proves your identity to a remote computer
</I>&gt;<i> * Protects e-mail messages
</I>&gt;<i> * Ensures software came from software publisher
</I>&gt;<i> * Protects software from alteration after publication
</I>&gt;<i> * Allows data to be signed with the current time
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Compared to Let's encrypt that is an intermediate CA with the next license:
</I>&gt;<i> * Protects e-mail messages
</I>&gt;<i> * Ensures the identity of a remote computer
</I>&gt;<i> * Proves your identity to a remote computer
</I>&gt;<i> * Allows data to be signed with the current time
</I>&gt;<i> * Allows data on disk to be encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> * 2.23.140.1.2.1
</I>&gt;<i> * 1.3.6.1.4.1.44947.1.1.1
</I>&gt;<i> * Document Signing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Those listed things above sound like the X.509 certificate 'use'
properties are what you actually need to be checking. Am I right?

&gt;<i> Which doesn't includes:
</I>&gt;<i> * Ensures software came from software publisher
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is critical for ISO bounded web services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In another words:
</I>&gt;<i> If the certificate is not EV ie the name of the corporation or business it means that it's not ISO compliance regarding
</I>&gt;<i> paying using a credit/visa/other card.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you are going to pay to someone over the Internet only pay if you know and validated the identity of the owner and\or orginzation.
</I>&gt;<i> This concept was introduced to prevent phishing and other things.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the exception I have seen is Paypal main site which does have EV named license/certificate but the name is not embedded into the certificate so I prefer not to buy in this specific site but buy locally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
A validator which checks for existence or non-existence of certain X.509
permissions would be the better approach instead of a curated whitelist
of CA names. That way;
 * you are not limited to whitelisting and its inherent &quot;human error&quot; or
incompleteness component biasing for/against any particular CAs,
 * you can publish the required criteria for transparency,
 * CAs can choose for themselves whether they adjust certs permissions
to be blocked or un-blocked without involving any tricky politics to
lower your required standard of proof.


Some CAs might for example have a special root CA with restricted
policies to comply with the ISO requirement, and another for their wider
use.
