So, surely all you need is a firewall to block any direct traffic which attempts 
to bypass the TLS client?

</I>
You say you want to use &quot;a TLS connection negotiated through a client using 
FIPS certified encryption&quot;.  What's at the other end of that connection (ie: 
what is your VM talking to to create this link)?

Are you saying that you want HTTPS connections from your VM to go only to 
remote servers which support this FIPS-certified TLS method, and no other 
websites should be accessible?

Or, are you trying to tunnel HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your VM to some trusted 
endpoint - if so, what happens to it from there?

Basically, given a connection from your VM to some random website, what part 
of the connection are you trying to encrypt in this specific way?


Regards,


Antony.
