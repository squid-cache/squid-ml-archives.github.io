<PRE>Hi Squid Community,

I am relatively new to Squid and I am facing the following issue, would truly appreciate if you could help.

Squid4.6 is used as a forward proxy to convert all traffic to secure traffic.
The configuration of squid is very simple, it allows all traffic and uses urlrewrite.pl to replace &quot;http&quot; to &quot;https&quot;.(SSL-BUMP is NOT used) Squid proxy has tls_outgoing_options set, so the following works:

  client(http) -----&gt; Squid ------&gt; Server(https)


Now, I am trying to replicate the same with websockets.
There are 3 test cases,
1.
   client(ws)------&gt; Squid -----&gt; Server(ws)

2.
   client(wss) ------&gt; Squid -----&gt; Server(wss)

3
   client(ws) ------&gt; Squid -----&gt; Server(wss)


The first two cases work with squid, but the third one does not work. And I only need the third option.
I have given debug logs for urlrewrite.pl to show the exact request received for a websocket connection, and the following is the log:
Here port 8080: is server and port 3128: is squid

DEBUG:root:localhost:8080 127.0.0.1/localhost - CONNECT myip=127.0.0.1 myport=3128


Even wireshark shows the same,
1. CONNECT HTTP 1.1
2. GET
3. upgrade protocol.

Question:
1.Is there any way to upgrade a websocket connection to secure websocket using squid4.6?
2.Or say I use wss-client (without certificate) and a wss-server(with certificates), is there a way to inform squid to use its own certificates even mentioned in &quot;tls_outgoing_options&quot; to establish the connection?

REQUIRED:
Client will always send a unsecure traffic HTTP/WS
and Squid should upgrade it to HTTPS/WSS.
In our application setup, we use our own openssl libraries to create certificates - which cannot be included in the (client.go) go-tls package, so we use squid proxy to use the certificates generated by our own openssl libraries.
Client and Forward-Proxy (Squid) are both in our specific environment, so squid.conf is very simple and allows all traffic.
And we need mutual cert authentication.

SQUID CONF CODE

                #
                # Recommended minimum configuration:
                #

                # Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
                # Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
                # should be allowed
                acl localhost src 127.0.0.1

                acl SSL_ports port 443
                acl Safe_ports port 443 # https
                acl Safe_ports port 80  # http
                acl CONNECT method CONNECT

                http_access deny !Safe_ports
                http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
                http_access allow localhost
                http_access deny all

                # Squid normally listens to port 3128
                http_port 3128

                url_rewrite_program /etc/squid/urlrewrite.pl
                url_rewrite_access allow  all
                tls_outgoing_options cert=/etc/squid/proxy.crt
                tls_outgoing_options key=/etc/squid/proxy.key
                tls_outgoing_options cafile=/etc/squid/serverauth.crt


urlrewrite CODE

                #!/usr/bin/perl
                select(STDOUT);
                $| = 1;
                while (&lt;&gt;) {
                                #print STDOUT &quot;OK rewrite-url=\&quot;<A HREF="https://google.com\">https://google.com\</A>&quot;\n&quot;;

                                if (/^(|\d+\s+)((\w+):\/+)([^\/:]+)(|:(\d+))(|\/\S*)(|\s.*)$/) {
                                                my $channel = $1;
                                                my $protocolClean = $3;
                                                my $domain = $4;
                                                my $port = $5;
                                                my $portClean = $6;
                                                my $urlPath = $7;

                                if ($protocolClean eq 'http' ){#&amp;&amp; ($port eq '' || $portClean eq '80')) {
                                                   print STDOUT &quot;${channel}OK rewrite-url=\&quot;<A HREF="https://${domain">https://${domain</A>}${port}${urlPath}\&quot;\n&quot;;
                                   #print STDOUT &quot;${channel}OK rewrite-url=\&quot;<A HREF="https://google.com\">https://google.com\</A>&quot;\n&quot;;
                                } else {
                                                   print STDOUT &quot;${channel}ERR\n&quot;;
                                }
                                }
                }

Thank you,
Shekhar
