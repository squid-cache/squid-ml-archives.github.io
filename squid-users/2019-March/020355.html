I believe a similar question has been answered a few years ago, and that
answer is still valid. I will quote that exchange below for your
convenience, but the source is at
<A HREF="http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-users/2016-September/012689.html">http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-users/2016-September/012689.html</A>

Item 3 includes an ICAP option that Antony suggested on this thread, and
I know there are eCAP adapters that implement raw HTTP traffic emulation
mentioned there.

</I>&gt;<i> 2. If IDS is content with reacting to something Squid can log while

</I>&gt;<i> script. External ACL input can be customized just like the access log.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If IDS needs access to message bodies, then use an ICAP or eCAP
</I>&gt;<i> service to give IDS whole messages. You may have to write or purchase
</I>&gt;<i> that service. How that service is going to give messages to IDS depends
</I>&gt;<i> on IDS interfaces. Some IDSes have APIs while others listen to raw
