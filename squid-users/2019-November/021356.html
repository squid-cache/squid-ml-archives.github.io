You must use ICAP status code 200 then. Make sure your encapsulated HTTP
307 body (if any) is properly sent to Squid.


&gt;<i> but squid

</I>&gt;<i> Adaptation::Icap::Xaction::noteCommRead threw exception: corrupted chunk
</I>&gt;<i> size
</I>
What chunk size did Squid not like? You should be able to tell by
looking at the packet capture of the failed transaction (or low-level
Squid debugging).


&gt;<i> We are not sending an ICAP header at this point because we already told
</I>&gt;<i> Squid ICAP 200 OK header and begun a body transaction, we send some
</I>&gt;<i> chunks back to the client for progress and hold the last part for scanning.
</I>
Are you sending HTTP 307 body chunks to Squid? How do you indicate that
no more chunks will be coming?

It sounds like you are trying to cram two HTTP messages (one with the
original HTTP response body prefix and one with a generated 307
redirect) into one ICAP response, which is impossible, but perhaps I
misunderstood your description. It would help if you post a sample (but
complete) ICAP response that Squid does not like.


&gt;<i> Ideally, we would like to just send our 307 to Squid and not having it
</I>&gt;<i> count as a failure.
</I>
Yes, a 200 ICAP response with an embedded HTTP 307 response should work
just fine, but all its pieces should be properly formed (and there
should be no extras).

Alex.
