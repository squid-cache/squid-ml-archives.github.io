(*) Your notes below imply that the ICAP server also sends the embedded
HTTP message header back to Squid (and not just the ICAP 200 header).


&gt;<i> &lt;data transfer begins&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ICAP server receives a chunk, checks if its the last chunk, if not then 
</I>&gt;<i> append to temp file and send it back to Squid;
</I>
The &quot;send it back to Squid&quot; part implies that not only your ICAP server
sent an ICAP 200 response header, but it sent the HTTP message header as
well. See (*) above. Once the ICAP server sent the HTTP message header,
it is committed to finish sending that HTTP message (and nothing else).


&gt;<i> if it is the last chunk then analyze the temp file for virus.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;repeat for next data transfer&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> If virus found then send encapsulated HTTP header 307 redirect.
</I>
This is an ICAP service bug: One cannot send a second encapsulated HTTP
message in one ICAP response. A single ICAP response cannot contain
multiple HTTP messages. The ICAP protocol does not allow for that, and
there would be no way to actually support something like that in an ICAP
client because the HTTP message cannot be interrupted and replaced with
another mid-flight. You may assume that the HTTP client is already
seeing the beginning of the first HTTP response. The train has left the
station.

If the above is accurate, and you are using the ICAP service correctly,
then the ICAP service that allowed you to do the above is badly broken,
probably written by somebody who thought that ICAP is &quot;easy&quot;. You may be
better off reusing an existing higher-quality ICAP service instead.


&gt;<i> If virus not found, send the last chunk to squid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The part where we send 307 is the part that Squid doesn't like, I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe is because we are not sending the last chunk since the file is a 
</I>&gt;<i> virus.
</I>
Not exactly: Even if you send the last HTTP chunk, you would not be able
to follow up with an HTTP 307 message. The HTTP fate of this transaction
was sealed when you started trickling virgin HTTP message pieces back to
Squid (and, hence, back to the HTTP client talking to Squid).


HTH,

Alex.
