Sounds good.


&gt;<i> It doesn't appear that there is a negative cache on the failure.
</I>
The peer up/down state is &quot;cached&quot;, but

1) Squid does not treat an HTTP 502 response as a peer failure (even
though the request may be re-forwarded after a 502 response). Roughly
speaking, only TCP- and TLS-level failures are considered to be peer
failures. HTTP responses, regardless of their status code, do not
increment the peer failure counter AFAICT.

2) By default, a peer is not considered down after the first 9 peer
failures. See cache_peer connect-fail-limit.

There is also a (complicated) peer revival mechanism that may mark a
previously &quot;down&quot; peer as &quot;up&quot; even though there were no HTTP requests
sent to that peer IIRC. The details are complex and depend on the Squid
version.


&gt;<i> it doesn't cache the re-forward response (a 200). Is that expected?
</I>
I do not think it should be expected. The number of past/failed
forwarding attempts should not affect response cachability IMO.


&gt;<i> is it possible from the logs to see the name or hostname:port of the
</I>&gt;<i> cache_peer being forwarded to?
</I>
The following logformat %codes may be helpful here (%&lt;a is logged by
default and is given here for completeness sake):

  %&lt;a  Server IP address of the last server or peer connection
  %&lt;A  Server FQDN or peer name
  %&lt;p  Server port number of the last server or peer connection

To log the last cache_peer_access match, you will need to use
annotate_transaction ACL and %note logformat code (where available).
However, IIRC, official Squids may evaluate the same matching
cache_peer_access rule many times per transaction, which may result in
confusing annotations.


HTH,

Alex.
