Glad you found a workaround!

</I>
It is not. I have not checked, but I would expect that Squid master/v5
(at least) will try to use that invalid outgoing address (and fail).
Needless to say, such futile attempts waste time and other resources.
They may also lead to misleading user-visible errors.


&gt;<i> So, is there a better / more elegant way to tell squid to use ipv4 only
</I>&gt;<i> when serving request for certain clients? 
</I>
tcp_outgoing_address is not meant for prohibiting destinations. I think
Squid should support use cases like yours explicitly: We should add a
new directive that only applies to direct destinations selected by the
existing peer selection algorithms:

    acl to_ipv6 dst ipv6
    direct_access deny to_ipv6 proxy-extra

I also considered extending cache_peer_access to apply to direct
destinations, but rejected that idea because we want to preserve
existing checks for cache_peer names in cache_peer_access and because
applying a directive called &quot;cache_peer...&quot; to direct connections is
unexpected/confusing.

We could also add a new ACL-driven directive to prohibit A or AAAA DNS
queries for certain names:

    dns_query_access AAAA deny proxy-extra

Using dns_query_access would save DNS resources in your use case, but
direct_access would cover a lot more use cases because it is a lot more
precise/selective (and not subject to DNS caching concerns).

Perhaps both directives should be added.
