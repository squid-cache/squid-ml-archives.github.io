Did that include the links I've given below?

Have you put this rule onto the firewall you mention, or the Squid box itself?

<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/InterceptionProxy">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/InterceptionProxy</A>
#Requirements_and_methods_for_Interception_Caching

states &quot;NAT configuration will only work when used *on the squid box* .&quot;

So, you *must* put that rule on the Squid machine itself, not on the firewall.

It goes on to say &quot;To intercept from a gateway machine and direct traffic at a 
separate squid box use policy routing.&quot; with a link to 
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/IptablesPolicyRoute">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/IptablesPolicyRoute</A>

&gt;<i> HTTP is coming to squid successfully but squid logs show a request coming
</I>&gt;<i> from proxy himself and a request coming from Router (as Clients are NATed
</I>&gt;<i> by Router)
</I>
Ah, so you *are* doing the NAT on the router :)  Don't :)

&gt;<i> if I allow in squid.conf the Proxy IP, I end up with a Forward loop...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also tried the tproxy scenario with no success.
</I>
Well, give us some details of what you tried, how you configured it, what 
worked, and what didn't work, and we might be able to help, otherwise we can 
only say &quot;well, tproxy does work if set up properly, so if yours doesn't work, 
it isn't set up properly&quot;, which isn't a very helpful answer...
