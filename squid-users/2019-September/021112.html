The answer to your question does not require a tool: Squid does slow
things down in most modern &quot;TLS everywhere&quot; environments, possibly
including yours. And if you do not decrypt traffic, then the answer is
likely even simpler: Squid slows down your traffic.

However, you are asking the wrong question. Since you _have to_ use
Squid (as you have said), the questions to ask are:

1. Does Squid slow things down right now more than it usually does? You
can answer that question by collecting and plotting various performance
stats from access logs and cache manager. You will see (or, better,
automatically detect!) when things suddenly go south.

2. Can we make Squid faster? The answer to that question is usually
&quot;yes&quot;, but it requires significant investment in bottleneck analysis
and, in some cases, development/optimization.
