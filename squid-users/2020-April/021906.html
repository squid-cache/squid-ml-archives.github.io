It seems to be like this on purpose:

<A HREF="https://deb.debian.org/">https://deb.debian.org/</A>

I'm not sure there is actually anything wrong with their DNS 
configuration, it's not required for the SRV record to point to the same 
name/address as the A record (which would in fact defeat the point of 
the SRV record).

It *might* be a bug in apt, since if the SRV record says to use 
prod.debian.map.fastly.net then maybe it ought to be using that as 
&quot;Host: &quot; in the HTTP headers, but I'm not sure about that. If it's 
supposed to use the original domain in the HTTP headers when using a SRV 
record then this could still be a failing of squid for not checking and 
considering valid the address from the HTTP SRV record.

I'll send them an email and see what they have to say about it.
