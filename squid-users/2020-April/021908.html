What are you trying to achieve by using Squid?  What is your objective, 
compared to giving clients direct access to the Internet?

&gt;<i> Server has two IP's.  One private internal and one public.  Can someone

</I>
Firstly, install Squid and look at its configuration file.  It is *very* well 
commented / documented, and there is *very* little you need to change in order 
to get it working on your network.

For more details, see:

&gt;<i> Do I need to create static routes?
</I>
Provided the machine you want install Squid on can reach (a) arbitrary web 
servers on the Internet, and (b) the client machines on your internal 
networks, then no.

If not, then yes, you will need to add suitable routes so that the Squid 
server can find both origin servers and clients.

&gt;<i> Do I need firewalld rules in place?
</I>
A firewall is always a good idea, however Squid imposes no special requirement 
of its own here.

A very good starting point for firewalls is &quot;allow the traffic you know you want, 
block the traffic you know you do not want, and log and block the traffic you're 
not sure about - then look at the logs and adjust the rules as necessary to 
keep the log entries minimal&quot;.


Finally, if you run into problems, come back here and tell us:

 - what you want to achieve
 - what you did to try to achieve it
 - how you tested whether it worked
 - what you found which told you it didn't work

Basically, give us enough information to understand what you're trying to do, 
what you've done to get there, and what went wrong (such that we could 
reproduce the problem for ourselves if need be), and people here will happily 
help out.


Regards,


Antony.
