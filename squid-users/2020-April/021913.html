Tell us more about your network setup.  Is the firewall between the clients and 
Squid, between Squid and the Internet, or do you have both?

Can you do a simple Ping test from a client machine to the Squid server (and 
get replies)?

Can you do the same from the Squid server to some Internet-based web server 
(making sure it's one which replies to pings - some machines are badly 
configured and don't do this).

&gt;<i> My squid access log is saying:  TCP_MISS/503.
</I>
I'm sure it says a lot more than that, but at least it's an indication that 
your client is getting the request through to Squid okay.

Assuming the Ping test from Squid to an Internet web server works, what 
happens if you try wget, lynx, curl or even telnet to port 80, from the Squid 
server to some external web server?  Does it indicate that the Squid server 
has &quot;Internet access&quot;?
