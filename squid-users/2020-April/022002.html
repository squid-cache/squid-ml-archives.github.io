Wow, that's impressive (in a way).

Squid 3.1 was released ten years ago (29 March 2010).

The current stable version of Squid is 4.11

I recommend you upgrade.  Aside from anything else, you're not going to find 
many people in a position to help out with such an old version, as well as the 
fact that it alomst certainly doesn't support certain features required by 
modern web browsers or servers.

Antony.
