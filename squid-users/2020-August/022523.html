<PRE>Amos,

Thank you for your reply.
It was very helpful.

&gt;<i> That number was gained before HTTPS became so popular. So YMMV depending
</I>&gt;<i> on how many CONNECT tunnels you have to deal with. That HTTPS traffic can
</I>possibly be decrypted
&gt;<i> and cached but performance trade-offs are quite large.
</I>
Squid uses SSL-Bump.
I'm very worried about the internet slowing down due to https decording.
and I'm also worried about the internet slowing down due to using Blacklist.
I load tens of thousands of URL(black list file) every time I set up ACL.

How many requests does SSL-Bump in one second?

Thank you,
kitamura

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We will install Squid on CentOS 8.1.   Please kindly share your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thoughts / advices
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever OS you are most comfortable with administering. Be aware that
</I>&gt;<i> CentOS official Squid packages are very slow to update - Apparently they
</I>&gt;<i> still have only v4.4 (8 months old) despite a 8.2 point release only a
</I>&gt;<i> few weeks ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you may need to be building your own from sources and/or using other
</I>&gt;<i> semi-official packagers such as the ones from Eliezer at NGTech when he
</I>&gt;<i> gets around to CentOS 8 packages.
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/CentOS">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/CentOS</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FYI; If you find yourself having to use SSL-Bump, then we highly
</I>&gt;<i> recommended to follow the latest Squid releases with fairly frequent
</I>&gt;<i> updates (at minimum a few times per year - worst case monthly). If you
</I>&gt;<i> like CentOS you may find Fedora more suitable to track the security
</I>&gt;<i> environment volatility and update churn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is there sizing methodology and tools?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of methodologies, depending on what aspect you are
</I>&gt;<i> tuning towards - and one for identifying the limitation points to begin
</I>&gt;<i> a tuning process tuning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The info you gave above is the beginning. Checking to see if your
</I>&gt;<i> traffic rate is reasonably within capability of a single Squid instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yours is reasonable, so next step is to get Squid running and see where
</I>&gt;<i> the trouble points (if any) are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  For more see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How much resources are generally recommended for our environment?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; CPU: Memory: Disk space : Other factors to be considered if any:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Do you have a generally recommended performance testing tools? Any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; suggested guidelines?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  CPU - squid is still mostly single-process. So prioritize faster GHz
</I>&gt;<i> rates over core number. Multi-core can help of course, but not as much
</I>&gt;<i> as cycle speeds do. Hyper-threading is useless for Squid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Memory - Squid will use as much as you can give it. Let your budget
</I>&gt;<i> govern this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Disk - Squid will happily run with no disk - or lots of large ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Avoid RAID. Squid *will* shorten disk lifetimes with its unusually
</I>&gt;<i> high write I/O pattern. How much shorter varies by disk type (HDD vs
</I>&gt;<i> SSD). So you may find it better to plan budget towards maintenance costs
</I>&gt;<i> of replacing disks in future rather than buying multiple up-front for
</I>&gt;<i> RAID use.
</I>&gt;<i>  see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/RAID">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/RAID</A>&gt; for details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Up to a few hundred GB per cache_dir can be good for large caches.
</I>&gt;<i> Going up to TB is not (yet) worth the disk cost as Squid has a per-cache
</I>&gt;<i> limit on stored objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Disk caches can be re-tuned, added, moved, removed, and/or extended
</I>&gt;<i> at any time and will depend on the profile of object sizes your proxy
</I>&gt;<i> handles - which itself likely changes over time. So general let your
</I>&gt;<i> budget decide the initial disks and work from there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Load Testing - the tools us dev use to review performance are listed at
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom of the profiling FAQ page. These are best for testing the
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical limits of a particular installation - real traffic tends to
</I>&gt;<i> be somewhat lower. So I personally prefer taking stats from the running
</I>&gt;<i> proxy on real traffic and seeing what I can observe from those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
