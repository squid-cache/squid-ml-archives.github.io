Eliezer's answer covers that already, so I will skip here.

This is &quot;unknown&quot; - as far as I am aware none has published numbers
recently about it. There are a lot of factors in the network traffic and
your servers internal state (eg the RNG engine) that multiply up to
cause varying amounts of delay - plus the volatile nature of this
feature set itself month by month changes the effects or relevance of
each factor.
  So numbers from me today will be wrong in a few weeks, or may be wrong
for your network already. All that we can be sure of is that there is
extra work needed by Squid thus &quot;slower&quot; than plain-text HTTP is to be
expected.

For planning the consideration is just to be aware that the numbers we
can give you (for plain-text) will be over-estimates of capacity for
SSL-Bump traffic and allow some margins. Once you have an install
running you can test and measure the actual numbers for your traffic.
