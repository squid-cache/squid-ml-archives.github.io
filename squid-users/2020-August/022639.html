</I>&gt;<i> Hi Squid Community,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the last weeks it felt that more and more websites are going to be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;incompatible&quot; with Squid SSL bump.
</I>
&quot;feelings&quot; aside, that is exactly the situation. SSL-Bump is literally a
security attack on clients traffic. Exactly the thing TLS is designed to
prevent.

As all our official SSL-Bump documentation says very prominently:
  &quot;when used properly TLS cannot be bumped&quot;.

There was a long period where very few websites used TLS properly. The
&quot;HTTPS Everywhere&quot; project has forced a lot of sites admin to get
experience with HTTPS and over time more networks are actually starting
to use it properly.

Which version are you using now?


&gt;<i> Some Websites are not displayed at all and a &quot;403 Forbidden&quot; from their
</I>&gt;<i> proxy is displayed, others are displayed very ugly because some CSS is
</I>&gt;<i> missing due to HTTP Error 403 on CSS resources.
</I>
&quot;their&quot;? Whose proxy?

If the problem is coming from a proxy that is not yours, contact its'
sysadmin.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way to tune SSL Bump for less problems with websites?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That depends on what you have configured (see below) and whether the
sites you are interested in are capable of being bumped (see above).


&gt;<i> Here some example websites which are not loading at all with SSL Bump:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - forcepoint.com (Their Proxy displays: 403 forbidden)
</I>&gt;<i> - itsg.de (Squid: Connect reset by peer)
</I>&gt;<i> - leica-geosystems.com (Bad Request)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Displayed very ugly because CSS Files gots HTTP Error 403 with SSL bump:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - pyur.com
</I>&gt;<i> - help.nextcloud.com
</I>&gt;<i> - it feels like all websites with Discourse Forums are having problems
</I>&gt;<i> with ssl bump - css missing, very ugly
</I>&gt;<i> - many more
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This are only some examples. Who can reproduce this problems with its
</I>&gt;<i> own SSL Bump Squid? Am I doing something wrong with SSL Bump? Is Squid 5
</I>&gt;<i> alerady better for this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Which version are you using now?
Exact version, as shown by squid -v, including OpenSSL library version.


&gt;<i> Thanks for any help

</I>&gt;<i> My current cump conf is extremely simple, just the default:
</I>
FYI; the *default* for SSL-Bump is not to exist. So no your config is
way beyond default, simple as it is.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> http_port proxy03bs.tld.com:8080 ssl-bump generate-host-certificates=on
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB cert=/etc/squid/certs/subca.crt.pem
</I>&gt;<i> key=/etc/squid/certs/subca.key.ohnersa.pem
</I>&gt;<i> sslcrtd_program /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -s /var/lib/ssl_db
</I>&gt;<i> -M 4MB
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump bump !domains_dont_sslbump
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This performs the bump action without any actual info from the TLS
server being &quot;bumped&quot;. So of course you can expect a lot of problems
with that.

A &quot;reliable&quot; (as much as it can be) configuration looks at the TLS
handshake from each endpoint before deciding which details to pass on
and which to change:


 acl step1 at_step SslBump1
 ssl_bump peek step1
 ssl_bump splice domains_dont_sslbump
 ssl_bump stare all
 ssl_bump bump all


Adding in your whitelist of non-bump domains would look like:

 acl step1 at_step SslBump1
 ssl_bump peek step1
 ssl_bump splice domains_dont_sslbump
 ssl_bump stare all
 ssl_bump bump all
