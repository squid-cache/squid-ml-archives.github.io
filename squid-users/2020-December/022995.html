What do you mean by that?  What are you using 400 ports for?

&gt;<i> We have decided that we want to add a cloud instance in the middle of the
</I>&gt;<i> connections, that will authenticate users and only then send them to the
</I>&gt;<i> squid instance.
</I>
What authentication method / protocol do you want to use?

&gt;<i> Is it a smart idea to use Squid for this use case or just use a different
</I>&gt;<i> proxy software that doesn't have this limitation?
</I>
I think the best starting point is to ask what sort of authentication you want 
to perform (ie: what is the authoritative system which holds the information 
about who can authenticate and who cannot), then you can decide on the best 
software to use to do that in front of Squid.

Under UK law, no VAT is charged on biscuits and cakes - they are &quot;zero rated&quot;.  
Chocolate covered biscuits, however, are classed as &quot;luxury items&quot; and are 
subject to VAT.  McVitie's classed its Jaffa Cakes as cakes, but in 1991 this 
was challenged by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise in court.

The question which had to be answered was what criteria should be used to 
class something as a cake or a biscuit.  McVitie's defended the classification 
of Jaffa Cakes as a cake by arguing that cakes go hard when stale, whereas 
biscuits go soft.  It was demonstrated that Jaffa Cakes become hard when stale 
and McVitie's won the case.
