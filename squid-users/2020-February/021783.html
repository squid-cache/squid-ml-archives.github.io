AFAIK, there is no such option. You might be able to fake it by denying
requests on IPv4-destined connections (via Squid ACLs and/or at the OS
level), in hope that requests on those denied connections will be
reforwarded, but I would not recommend this clumsy approach.

However, it is easy to add a DNS forwarder that would immediately
respond to all Squid A queries with an empty set of IPv4 addresses. If
you cannot configure BIND/etc. to do that, then it would only take a few
lines of code to write such a forwarder in Perl/etc. using existing DNS
resolver libraries -- you do not need a generic forwarder; only
something that can handle Squid queries...

What are you going to do with sites that have no IPv6 addresses?

Alex.
