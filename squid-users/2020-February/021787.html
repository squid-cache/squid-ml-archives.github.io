</I>&gt;<i> My question is how squid or under which circumstances can go to IPV4 as long as IPV6 dual stack exist ? How come it used 98 % for FB  IPV6 destinations as an example and 2 % FB IPV4 destinations .

</I>

Could be any number of reasons.
 - the IPv6 pipe on your network being full making the IPv4 routes
faster sometimes.
 - other transient routing issues causing connection failures when IPv6
was tried, Squid falling back to IPv4 which worked.
 - DNS resolver failing to supply AAAA fast enough so Squid uses A
result for some connections.

... or a mix of all reasons.


&gt;<i> Is it random process or DNS answers type ?
</I>
DNS answers using &quot;Happy Eyeballs&quot; algorithms. With AAAA results
preferred over tried before A results when both are available.


&gt;<i>  Also Have not found squid directives for this area .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an option to tell squid use AAAA DNS reply from DNS for certain websites always or even with certain squid process  ? And others non Dual stack use default case ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The BCP specifications require both to be supported with a preference
towards IPv6 whenever possible. That is what Squid does. We only provide
the --disable-ipv6 and dns_v4_first for networks with seriously broken
IPv6 setups, and both already deprecated.
