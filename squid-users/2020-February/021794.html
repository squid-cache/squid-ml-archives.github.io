I do not remember which Squid version the OP is using, but most Happy
Eyeballs-related changes are only available starting with v5. Before v5
commit fd9c47d, Squid was indeed waiting for both A and AAAA answers if
both queries were sent, breaking use cases where one query answer was
badly delayed.

For v5+ users:

In practice, &quot;when both are available&quot; in Amos explanation means &quot;when
both are found in Squid's DNS cache&quot;. In all other cases (i.e., none
found or just one family of addresses is found), Happy Eyeballs tries to
establish a TCP connection with the first available IP address (e.g.,
the first one to get resolved), regardless of that address family.

IIRC, if Squid has to send both A and AAAA queries to resolve a domain,
Squid always sends AAAA first, so there is some IPv6 bias in that case,
but there is no artificial delay between the two queries.


HTH,

Alex.
