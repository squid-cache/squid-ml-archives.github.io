Of Googles 8.8.8.8 resolver? it produces different types of result based
on where one queries from.

There is also the possibility of route engineering by the two ISP being
different for some destination networks. That could changes some traffic
in ways that are visible on inspection.

Or also on the network layer side of things oddities in the particular
routers each ISP uses may result in differences in MTU, ECN etc handling
that also affects some traffic routes in different ways for each of the
two ISP.
