I assume you are hitting assert(request != newRequest).

</I>

IIRC, Squid ICAP client code creates a new request structure even if no
adaptation happened at the ICAP service. This is a deficiency of that
old code (some may say a bug, but there could have been good reasons to
make it that way back then because that request structure is &quot;special&quot;
and may have been difficult to reuse -- I am not sure).

Apparently, there is some other adaptation code that does not create a
new request structure. I speculate that it may be the request routing
code that lives outside the ICAP space (it also serves eCAP adapters).
For a specific example, see Adaptation::Iterator::step() -- I see no
obvious/immediate signs there that theMsg is a new message and not the
virgin one. IIRC, theMsg starts as a virgin message structure.

I suspect that the correct fix would be to stop requiring a new request
structure for the akForward Answers. Instead, handleAdaptedHeader()
should accommodate the case where the request structure was preserved
and does not need to be reset. In other words, a Forward(x) answer
should not imply that the original message was (not) adapted.

Other Answer recipients should be checked for a similar problem.


HTH,

Alex.
