Bugs notwithstanding, the only reason the above configuration could
result in a bumped connection is if Squid wants to report an error to
the client. To make progress, you need to find out what that error is.

* I would start by examining access.log records after adding
%err_code/%err_detail to your custom logformat.

* If that does not help (we are still working on detailing various
errors better), I would look at cache.log after setting debug_options to
ALL,2 or higher.

* If that does not help, I would share a link to a compressed cache.log
after setting debug_options to ALL,9 and reproducing the problem using a
single transaction (to the extent possible).


&gt;<i> I know these errors have been a hot topic, and from what I can find

</I>
I agree that host forgery detection should not block intercepted
connections and CONNECT tunnels (by default). I do not know how close
Squid is to that ideal -- there may be some holes in following that rule
of thumb. Also, I do not know whether your connections are bumped due to
these false positives or some other error. See above for the suggested
next steps.


HTH,

Alex.
