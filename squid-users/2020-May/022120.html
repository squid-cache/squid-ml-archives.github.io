Because origin server and explicit proxy traffic are mutually exclusive
syntax at the HTTP level, and use different types of SSL certificate at
the TLS level.

A &quot;Secure proxy&quot; receives explicit-proxy HTTP traffic over TLS. That
traffic gets decrypted normally on receipt by the https_port, using a
proxy server certificate.

SSL-Bump auto-generates a server certificate to decrypt with, and
expects origin form HTTP syntax once decrypted.


HTTPS traffic as we know it (CONNECT tunnels to port 443) might still be
sent to a secure proxy. In which case there are two layers of encryption
nested inside each other. Decrypting the interior layer of at is not yet
supported by Squid.
