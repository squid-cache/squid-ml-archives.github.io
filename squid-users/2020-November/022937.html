</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can easily see the requests that I want to capture inside the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;network&quot; tab in Chrome but the problem is that Instagram uses HTTPS, so 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't seem to be able to capture this data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way for me to log this data via Squid using the POST data

Access to HTTPS transactions for a domain you do not own requires the 
SSL-Bump feature to decrypt (&quot;bump&quot;) the TLS layer.
  see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>&gt;.

You could use cache.log with &quot;debug_options ALL,1 11,2&quot; configured to 
log the transactions. However an ICAP service or eCAP module that does 
both the record and analyze for you is probably better.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: We are aware of the legal issues, all machines connected to the 
</I>&gt;<i> network are company property, and all the accounts are client accounts 
</I>&gt;<i> that allow us to gather statistics. No personal account data&#160;will be 
</I>&gt;<i> gathered.
</I>

Please be aware:
   That statement conflicts with the stated purpose(s) of your plan.

Personal data *will* be part of the messages you are decrypting and 
recording for analysis. Further, to perform targeted reports such as 
described you must also associate the data with accounts somehow.
