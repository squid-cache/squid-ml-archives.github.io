Show us the command you use to compile it.

&gt;<i> workers just write in squid.conf.
</I>
I don't think you understood what I meant by &quot;details&quot; - show us exactly what 
you have put into the config file so that we might be able to try the same thing 
on another machine, or perhaps spot a syntax error, or otherwise help to 
identify the problem.

As it is, you've basically said &quot;I've done something, and the result doesn't 
work.&quot;  You haven't shown us what the &quot;something&quot; is, and you haven't shown us 
any output of the way in which it fails, so we have no real information to go 
on to help resolve the problem.

&gt;<i> If it doesn't work, it starts for a moment when you start squid and then
</I>&gt;<i> stops immediately.
</I>
What is written into the log file?

&gt;<i> Workers squid works fine with the 4.4 package.
</I>
Good.
