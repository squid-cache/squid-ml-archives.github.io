When did your Squid workers print their &quot;Accepting ... connections at
...&quot; message(s)? Those messages will give you the approximate time of
sd_notify() calls made by Squid workers.


&gt;<i> Squid cache.log shows no error w.r.t. notify and seems to start correctly.
</I>
AFAICT, Squid code does not report sd_notify() failure to notify iff
that failure was due to an unset $NOTIFY_SOCKET variable. The first
sd_notify() call in Squid also unsets $NOTIFY_SOCKET variable (in the
calling worker). However, I cannot explain why that variable would be
unset during the first sd_notify() call _sometimes_.

Perhaps systemd is confused by concurrent notifications coming from
multiple workers?

Can you enable some kind of sd_notify() debugging that would show us
what the first sd_notify() call was doing and when/whether systemd
received the notification from Squid?

Alex.
