I don't see the connection being a reseller service has to do with
routing to specific proxies.

Surely the routing is based on something entirely different - such as
the users credit balance with services, or which packages they have
bought from you, which region(s) they are trying to access etc.

That type of info is traditionally managed via assigning users to
groups. In modern Squid it is more efficiently done with annotations and
&quot;note&quot; ACL as mentioned by Eliezer already.

</I>

There is nothing in the PacketStream documentation or FAQ that indicates
routing to specific proxies based on user/password details.

Their on-sellers simply add/remove login accounts and payments to the
main system.
