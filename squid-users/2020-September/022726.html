</I>PacketStream does in fact route specific proxies based on the user password (I have an account with them).

It uses country and stick/random IPs categories.

E.g. this routes to a random country proxy AND constantly changes the IP:

mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1:proxy.packetstream.io:
This routes to a United States proxy AND constantly changes the IP:

mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates:proxy.packetstream.io:32712
This routes to a United States proxy AND a sticky IP:
mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates_session-M9OtVn9p:proxy.packetstream.io:32712
Additionally, different session IDs are used to map to different sticky IP proxies:
 mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates_session-Pux68O1z:proxy.packetstream.io:32712 mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates_session-SbbaynPQ:proxy.packetstream.io:32712 mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates_session-ybhX9gIf:proxy.packetstream.io:32712 mark251:fq4zEWC1B5A194C1_country-UnitedStates_session-dFgoeQMY:proxy.packetstream.io:32712
So there's definitely a reason to do this.
My question is how does PacketStream do this?

I don't see the connection being a reseller service has to do with
routing to specific proxies.

Surely the routing is based on something entirely different - such as
the users credit balance with services, or which packages they have
bought from you, which region(s) they are trying to access etc.

That type of info is traditionally managed via assigning users to
groups. In modern Squid it is more efficiently done with annotations and
&quot;note&quot; ACL as mentioned by Eliezer already.

</I>

There is nothing in the PacketStream documentation or FAQ that indicates
routing to specific proxies based on user/password details.

Their on-sellers simply add/remove login accounts and payments to the
main system.
