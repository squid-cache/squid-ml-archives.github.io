<PRE>Just to add a side note:
Squid is not the most advanced proxy in the Programming world.

It's possible that many use Squid as their proxy servers software however,
in the programming world there are far more simple and efficient ways to write 
a proxy that will serve a service such as PacketStream.
A proxy server with auth, logging and much more  can be written in 200 +- lines of code.
OK OK so it is connected to a K\V or SQL DB...

Haproxy is an OpenSource example for a very efficient proxy service, leaving aside the 
obviates differences between Squid and Haproxy.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

I don't see the connection being a reseller service has to do with
routing to specific proxies.

Surely the routing is based on something entirely different - such as
the users credit balance with services, or which packages they have
bought from you, which region(s) they are trying to access etc.

That type of info is traditionally managed via assigning users to
groups. In modern Squid it is more efficiently done with annotations and
&quot;note&quot; ACL as mentioned by Eliezer already.

</I>

There is nothing in the PacketStream documentation or FAQ that indicates
routing to specific proxies based on user/password details.

Their on-sellers simply add/remove login accounts and payments to the
main system.
