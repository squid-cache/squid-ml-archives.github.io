Some additional information would be good, and a lot less HTML would be good 
too :)  Just a comment &quot;I got the expected content&quot; is sufficient...

</I>
Are you using Squid to connect to Apache on that machine, or using Squid to 
connect out to the Internet in general?

In other words, what is the relevance of Apache running on this machine?

Also, I do not understand the word &quot;but&quot; in your sentence (but maybe this is 
just a language thing).  It makes it sound to me as though something is not 
quite right, but then you say &quot;giving you the results you need&quot;, so it's 
working nicely?

&gt;<i> On my second machine also fitted with opensuse 15.1 but with no internet

</I>
Tell us a little about your network arrangement:

1. What's the IP address of the client machine (the one with no direct 
Internet connection)?

2. What's the internal IP address of the machine running Squid (no need to 
tell us its public IP address)?

&gt;<i> When I installed windows 10 it works but on opensuse not?
</I>
On the same physical server?

&gt;<i> This I got when using squidclient:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> server:/home/peter #squidclient <A HREF="http://peterspretpaleis.xs4all.nl">http://peterspretpaleis.xs4all.nl</A>
</I>
Is &quot;server&quot; the machine with Squid running on it?

&gt;<i> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</I>
Okay, so it works - no need to show us hundreds of lines of web page source 
code :)

What we do need to see though is:

1. How are you testing from the machine that does not work?

2. What shows up in Squid's log files when you try to access a site from the 
machine that does not work?

3. What changes have you made to the default Squid configuration file (please do 
not send us the entire file - at most please just show us the non-comment 
lines)?

Which firewall?

Do you have a public IP address on your Squid server?  If so I strongly 
recommend that you turn your firewall back on again.
