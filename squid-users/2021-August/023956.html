<PRE>Hi,

English is not my native tongue so I am sorry for any mistakes that I've 
made or will make in the future.

To answer your questions:

Both apache and suid are running of the same machine. This I like to 
call the server.

Then on another machine, lets call it the client,&#160; there is also 
opensuse 15.1 but with another purpose. When this client is directly 
connected to the internet is cannot connect to the server.

The relevance of apache is that on some mysterious way I would be able 
to check if squid is working but I just installed it and I have to 
figure this one out.

DHCP and DNS are working. The client machine gets an IP address from the 
server.

On the second card i have designated an ip address which is 192.168.1.1 
and the range on which the client computers can connect 192.168.1.20 
through 192.168.1.50.

When using squid in firefox it should connect to <A HREF="http://192.168.1.1:3128">http://192.168.1.1:3128</A>

but it does not...

Question:

Where are the log files?

How do I read the log files?

What log-files are relevant to answer the mystery of not connecting?

the firewall is off and stays off. I have only the ports 21, 80 and 443 
open.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I installed windows 10 it works but on opensuse not?
</I>&gt;<i> On the same physical server?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This I got when using squidclient:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server:/home/peter #squidclient <A HREF="http://peterspretpaleis.xs4all.nl">http://peterspretpaleis.xs4all.nl</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Is &quot;server&quot; the machine with Squid running on it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, so it works - no need to show us hundreds of lines of web page source
</I>&gt;<i> code :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we do need to see though is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How are you testing from the machine that does not work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What shows up in Squid's log files when you try to access a site from the
</I>&gt;<i> machine that does not work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. What changes have you made to the default Squid configuration file (please do
</I>&gt;<i> not send us the entire file - at most please just show us the non-comment
</I>&gt;<i> lines)?
