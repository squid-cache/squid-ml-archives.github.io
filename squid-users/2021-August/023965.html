<PRE>Because I have a multi port modem/router that connects to the internet.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> English is not my native tongue so I am sorry for any mistakes that I've

</I>&gt;<i> That's not problem - I just wanted to make sure I understood your meaning
</I>&gt;<i> (which I did).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both apache and squid are running of the same machine. This I like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call the server.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then on another machine, lets call it the client,  there is also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensuse 15.1 but with another purpose. When this client is directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected to the internet is cannot connect to the server.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not understand that part.  Why can you not have two machines on one
</I>&gt;<i> network which can both connect to the Internet and also connect to each other?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does each machine connect to the Internet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The relevance of apache is that on some mysterious way I would be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to check if squid is working but I just installed it and I have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> figure this one out.
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that the best way to find out whether Squid is working is
</I>&gt;<i> either to use Squid itself, or to check whether it is listening on port 3128,
</I>&gt;<i> or perhaps even use something like Icinga2 (although that's prbably going a
</I>&gt;<i> bit far just to &quot;find out whether Squid is working&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DHCP and DNS are working. The client machine gets an IP address from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i> So, the client machien gets an IP address from the server by DHCP, and it gets
</I>&gt;<i> told to ask the server for DNS queries (which the server then performs and
</I>&gt;<i> returns the results)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the second card i have designated an ip address which is 192.168.1.1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the range on which the client computers can connect 192.168.1.20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through 192.168.1.50.
</I>&gt;<i> So, it sounds as though you are using the server as a router, with a public
</I>&gt;<i> address on one interface and a private address on the other.  This doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> explain to me why the client cannot access the Internet through the server,
</I>&gt;<i> acting as a router.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When using squid in firefox it should connect <A HREF="tohttp://192.168.1.1:3128">tohttp://192.168.1.1:3128</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it does not...
</I>&gt;<i> You mean, it does not even connect to the proxy, or it does connect and the
</I>&gt;<i> proxy does not work correctly, so you get no content from Internet websites?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Question:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where are the log files?
</I>&gt;<i> Usually, /var/log/squid/*.log
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I read the log files?
</I>&gt;<i> less?  cat?  vim?  grep?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What log-files are relevant to answer the mystery of not connecting?
</I>&gt;<i> I would start with access.log.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the firewall is off and stays off. I have only the ports 21, 80 and 443
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open.
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, that is far from my definition of &quot;off&quot;.  It means your firewall is active,
</I>&gt;<i> and blocking connections other than FTP (why???), HTTP and HTTPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this firewall running on your &quot;server&quot; or on some modem/router which the
</I>&gt;<i> server uses to connect to the Internet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If these firewall rules are on your &quot;server&quot;, is there a rule allowing the
</I>&gt;<i> client machine/s to connect to Squid on port 3128?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How are you testing from the client machine?  What exactly happens when you
</I>&gt;<i> try?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What shows up in Squid's access.log when you attempt to connect from the
</I>&gt;<i> client machine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. What changes have you made to the default Squid configuration file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, while we're at it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Are you trying to implement Squid purely in order to give the client
</I>&gt;<i> machine access to the Internet, simply because otherwise it cannot?  If that
</I>&gt;<i> is the case, why not simply route the client machine through the server so
</I>&gt;<i> that the client can access the Internet directly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Antony.
