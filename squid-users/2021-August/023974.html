</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I learned to make the most important settings in the config file, but I

</I>

see &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl</A>&gt;



&gt;<i> 2) proxy functions work nicely but sometimes the squid proxy &quot;locks up&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no data flow for 2-3 minutes. It usually helps to wait or 
</I>&gt;<i> restart the service. How to prevent this? The internet link is good, 
</I>&gt;<i> probably a problem with hidden bugs in the squid proxy or wrong settings 
</I>&gt;<i> (how to increase stability)?
</I>

This being Squid-2 it could be quite a lot of things that have long ago 
been solved and forgotten about. First thing to do is try an upgrade.



&gt;<i> 3) number of simultaneous connections per client and globally, How to 
</I>&gt;<i> set up win10 64bit, specifically for squid proxy service? If i need to 
</I>&gt;<i> configure the OS as well, ask me how.
</I>

Windows APIs used by Squid-2 have a hard limit that cannot be changed.


&gt;<i> 4) how to turn off caching. The idea is to just redirect http traffic 
</I>&gt;<i> and always ask/force latest&#160;version of site online? No need to make a 
</I>&gt;<i> local copy/cache, just raw proxy between lan and ether/internet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

In Squid-2:

   cache deny all
   cache_mem 0
   cache_dir /dev/null parent 0


In modern Squid just remove any cache_dir you have.


&gt;<i> note: all of the above issues and issues are related to version 2.72. If 
</I>&gt;<i> v4.14 64-bit version that I downloaded from diladele site yesterday 
</I>&gt;<i> works better and not have&#160;problems, then great. In any case, a couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> examples for squid.conf would help me, I would be very grateful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Squid-2 is HTTP/1.0 software which is 5+ years obsolete now.

Go with the Diladele Squid-4, it is modern HTTP/1.1 software and most of 
the help you will be able to get relies on features only found in the 
Squid-3+ releases.
