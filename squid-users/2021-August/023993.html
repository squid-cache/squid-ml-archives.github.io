What refused - Squid or the client Browser?

Do you still have a copy of the old Squid-2 config file?
  You will at very least need to copy some of the details across.

</I>
Edit the &quot;acl localnet&quot; lines in squid.conf to only contain that IP range.


&gt;<i> and proxy is 
</I>&gt;<i> their gateway.
</I>
That is a network and/or client setting. Same as was done when you used 
Squid-2. It depends on your network topology/design and software used 
how that is done.


&gt;<i> Then the internet bandwidth per client and the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> connections per client to be limited,
</I>
Copy the delay_* lines from your Squid-2 config file.


&gt;<i> the dns servers to be configured 
</I>&gt;<i> and the listening ports (3128 as default and 808 as aditional one).
</I>
Look for the http_port lines in squid.conf. You should find 3128 already 
present. Add a line &quot;http_port 808&quot; there.

NP: If the 3128 line is commented out (some distributors do) that may be 
the connect problem, remove the '#'.
