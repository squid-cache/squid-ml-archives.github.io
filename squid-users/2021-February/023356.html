I'm not seeing any syntax issues. Though I do not use LDAP myself and 
not very familiar with its syntax requirements.


&gt;<i> I don't see what I am missing here,because connection is OK in cache.log.

As far as I understand there is no issues with the connection to LDAP 
service. There are issues with the things it is being required to do.

Since you have used -d to enable debug, there should be some lines added 
to cache.log by the helper about what it is doing and the results of 
each action. If none of those lines give you a hint, please try pasting 
them in a mail here and someone else might be able to spot something.
