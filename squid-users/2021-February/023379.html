I suspect you assume that a forward DNS lookup (A or AAAA query) answer
is always the &quot;opposite&quot; of a reverse DSN lookup (PTR query) answer.
AFAIK, that is not how DNS is defined. From DNS point of view, each of
those answers is totally independent -- there is no 1:1 or even 1:N
mapping between them; the answers even come from different DNS zones!  A
caching DNS resolver would probably violate the DNS protocol if it uses
a cached A or AAAA record to answer a PTR query. Disclaimer: I am not a
DNS expert.


&gt;<i> From my understanding, when you open a
</I>&gt;<i> browser and browse to www.google.com, the very
</I>&gt;<i> first thing that happens is you do a DNS resolution so that you know
</I>&gt;<i> what IP to send the CONNECT request and subsequent HTTPS records in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>
What happens depends on the browser and the proxy port:

1. For forward proxies: Some browsers will not do DNS lookups. They will
send a CONNECT request to example.com, allowing Squid to do the DNS
lookup. In this case, Squid dstdomain configured with a host name will
work well.

2. For forward proxies: Some browsers do DNS lookups. They will send a
CONNECT request to one of the returned IP addresses.

3. For interception proxies: All browsers do DNS lookups. They open a
TCP connection to one of the returned IP addresses.

In cases 2 and 3, Squid dstdomain will have to do a reverse DNS lookup
(PTR query). In many cases, that lookup either fails or returns a
different domain name than the domain the browser started with.


HTH,

Alex.
