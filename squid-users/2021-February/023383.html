Correct, but that does not really matter.


&gt;<i> Hence the need for a reverse DNS from
</I>&gt;<i> squid, since squid does not know at that point what domain the IP
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to.
</I>
Squid &quot;does not know&quot; because all Squid gets is an IP address (in those
two cases).


&gt;<i> But they still had to query the DNS server, so that entry is
</I>&gt;<i> in that DNS cache, and it should have the same domain as the lookup that
</I>&gt;<i> the user entered.
</I>
DNS does not support what feels natural to you. You are thinking of a
name:IP cache entry that can be looked up by IP. That is a natural
model, but it does not match reality. DNS simply does not have an
interface that says &quot;find me a name that maps to IP Y&quot;. DNS essentially
has only one interface: &quot;find me what maps to name X&quot;. That is it! There
is just no way to ask a DNS server what name in its cache maps to an IP
address.

For reverse DNS lookups, the DNS client constructs an IP-based _name_ in
a special in-addr.arpa DNS zone and uses that name to query the DNS
server. For example, a &quot;reverse&quot; lookup for 127.0.0.1 is really a lookup
for the &quot;1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa&quot; name. And that lookup follows all the
DNS rules about contacting authoritative servers for the zone, etc.; the
DNS server does not really &quot;know&quot; that what you really want is a cached
domain name for that 127.0.0.1 IP address.


&gt;<i> So if I have a local dns (maybe dnsmasq) that both squid and the user
</I>&gt;<i> use, from what I understand I should be able to use squid's
</I>&gt;<i> dns_nameservers directive to point to that DNS, and it should return
</I>&gt;<i> fine since it is stored right there in the cache.
</I>
The IP may be stored, but it cannot be looked up using DNS.

</I>&gt;<i>     AFAIK, that is not how DNS is defined. From DNS point of view, each of

</I>&gt;<i>     a cached A or AAAA record to answer a PTR query. Disclaimer: I am not a
</I>&gt;<i>     DNS expert.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; From my understanding, when you open a
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; browser and browse to www.google.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</A>&gt;, the very
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; first thing that happens is you do a DNS resolution so that you know
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; what IP to send the CONNECT request and subsequent HTTPS records
</I>&gt;<i>     in the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     What happens depends on the browser and the proxy port:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1. For forward proxies: Some browsers will not do DNS lookups. They will
</I>&gt;<i>     send a CONNECT request to example.com &lt;<A HREF="http://example.com">http://example.com</A>&gt;, allowing
</I>&gt;<i>     Squid to do the DNS
</I>&gt;<i>     lookup. In this case, Squid dstdomain configured with a host name will
</I>&gt;<i>     work well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     2. For forward proxies: Some browsers do DNS lookups. They will send a
</I>&gt;<i>     CONNECT request to one of the returned IP addresses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     3. For interception proxies: All browsers do DNS lookups. They open a
</I>&gt;<i>     TCP connection to one of the returned IP addresses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     In cases 2 and 3, Squid dstdomain will have to do a reverse DNS lookup
</I>&gt;<i>     (PTR query). In many cases, that lookup either fails or returns a
</I>&gt;<i>     different domain name than the domain the browser started with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     HTH,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Alex.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; So we would have the IP already, and the hostname that was
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; looked up already in the DNS cache, right? Why wouldn't squid just be
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; able to reach in there, match the IP that DNS returned, and then pull
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; that hostname out to compare against the ACLs?
