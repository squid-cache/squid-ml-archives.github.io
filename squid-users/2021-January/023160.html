<PRE>Even with splice???
This is a weird way of MS Store of handling things

I was sure that when I am using SPLICE it is expected to work.
Maybe there is a way to handle these IP addresses before even peeking, which
should work.
I think that there is some level of a BUMP happening when it shouldn't.
I will try to test it with another proxy which only looks at the SNI.

connection is so hardwired that it doesn't accept a redirect. So it sees
that and become suspicious (Windows Update is extremely suspicious :D)

For some antivirus (avast maybe? I don't remember) the updater actually
checks the server certificate fingerprint so you can't bump it and you
need a special NAT rule for all the fscking IPs it uses (if you set a
proxy it does a connect BY IP and not by name, and the IPs are hardcoded
and not resolved by DNS).

So it is possible you can't bump a store connection (remember that
technically a bump is a MITM intrusion that TLS is explicitely design to
detect!)
