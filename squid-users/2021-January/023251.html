AFAICT, this Squid worker (rather than the helper) crashes/asserts. The
master process restarts the worker 10 times (because the worker keeps
crashing/asserting) and then gives up and kills the entire instance.

FWIW, I would prefer if Squid worker did not assert. Whether the worker
should quit when its helper fails is debatable and perhaps should be
configurable. In most environments/cases, killing the affected Squid
_transaction_ is much better than killing the Squid worker (and then
killing the entire Squid instance), but there may be exception worth
supporting (via configuration).


HTH,

Alex.
