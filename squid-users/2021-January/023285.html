</I>
Sorry, I didn't say much in fact.
I gave for granted that it was C-ICAP who stopped answering; I didn't 
suspect a Squid bug and had no other idea.



&gt;<i> If you are talking about Squid timing out when attempting to establish a
</I>&gt;<i> TCP connection with the ICAP server, then this may by as much insight as
</I>&gt;<i> you can get from the Squid side.
</I>
What I hoped to find in Squid logs was *what* was being passed to C-ICAP 
when it locked.
I'll try on the C-ICAP side then.



&gt;<i> I do not know much about c-icap, but I would check whether its
</I>&gt;<i> configuration or something like crontab results in hourly restarts and
</I>&gt;<i> associated loss of connectivity.
</I>
AFAIK no.



&gt;<i> The network interface or the routing tables might also be reset hourly
</I>
They live on the same host.



&gt;<i> The ICAP server/service might be running out of descriptors or memory.
</I>
I'd expect it to log that, but I'll investigate better.



&gt;<i> One potentially useful test is to try to connect to the ICAP server
</I>&gt;<i> _while the problem is happening_ using telnet or netcat. When Squid
</I>&gt;<i> cannot establish a connection, can you?
</I>
I'll try, but it's going to be hard, since this happens for a few 
minutes once a day at most.



&gt;<i> Packet captures can tell you whether other Squid-ICAP server connections
</I>&gt;<i> were active at the time, whether from-Squid SYN packets were able to
</I>&gt;<i> reach the ICAP server, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, basic network troubleshooting steps...
</I>
As I said, they live on the same host, so it can't be a network problem.



&gt;<i> Higher timeout will delay HTTP client transactions for longer periods of
</I>&gt;<i> time, of course. If you want to go down the road of finding workarounds,
</I>&gt;<i> then check whether raising that timeout actually helps. It is not yet
</I>&gt;<i> clear (to me) whether the connections just need more time to be
</I>&gt;<i> established or are simply doomed.
</I>
It's not clear to me either, but I suspect so, given the trouble only 
last a few minutes.




&gt;&gt;<i> Same for disabling icap_service_failure_limit?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is an essential ICAP service (icap_service bypass=off). I assume
</I>&gt;<i> there is no backup service -- no adaptation_service_set in play here. If
</I>&gt;<i> so, disabling the limit means that fewer HTTP transactions will be
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenienced in the long run than if the service were to be suspended.
</I>&gt;<i>   Hence, fewer ICAP errors will be delivered to Squid clients.
</I>
Agreed.



&gt;<i> You can also enable bypass.
</I>
I guess this would open a potential for an attack.
DoS the service (antivirus), then let something nasty pass...



&gt;<i> Fixing the problem would be a much better solution, of course.
</I>
Sure, I know these are workarounds and I'd rather avoid them, but I'll 
need to consider them as a last resort.



  bye &amp; Thanks
