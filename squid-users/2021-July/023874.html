If you're trying to download a specific file from a specific server, which 
doesn't support current encryption protocols, is it absolutely essential to 
you that you download it via Squid?

In other words, I suggest you just connect to the machine directly, download 
the file, and then either forget about the server's outdated encryption 
capabilities, or inform the website maintainers (if there are any?) and see 
whether they care enough to bring it up to date.

Either way, you have your file, and you don't have to work out how to persuade 
Squid to do somethng that's really not a good idea to start with.

achievement you get from getting them to work at all. In other words - and 
this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's 
Galaxy-wide success is founded - their fundamental design flaws are completely 
hidden by their superficial design flaws.&quot;
