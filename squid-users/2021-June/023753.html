This is a Squid bug. Please consider creating a Bugzilla entry and
posting the corresponding backtrace there:
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting#crashes_and_core_dumps">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting#crashes_and_core_dumps</A>


&gt;<i> ERROR: Collapsed forwarding queue overflow for kid1 at 1024 items
</I>
This can be an expected side effect of a kid restart or a bug. If these
errors go away shortly after the kid, then they are expected -- other
kids are trying to communicate with a dead/restarting kid and complain
when they cannot. Squid handling of kid restarts is very primitive.
Quality improvements are welcome.


&gt;<i> This one seems to be impossible for us to track down. It doesn't show
</I>&gt;<i> up immediately, but always ends up coming back, and can be multiple
</I>&gt;<i> times per second when we have a high usage peak. We've tried:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Enabling/disabling &quot;collapsed_forwarding&quot;, nothing changes. It should
</I>&gt;<i>    be off by default, but this message is there nevertheless.
</I>
The message text is misleading because it is outdated. That queue was
originally used exclusively for collapsed forwarding needs, but it is
now used for other essential purposes as well -- cachable traffic should
be using the transients queue now.


&gt;<i>  * Recompiling squid with the value raised to 4096. Same message with
</I>&gt;<i>    the new value.
</I>
If the overflow is related to kid crashes, then raising the limit like
that may not help on a busy proxy -- the queue will just overflow a few
seconds later. The solution is to fix those crashes.

If the overflow occurs without crashes, then there may be a bug
somewhere or your Squids are blocking/stalling for some reason.


&gt;<i>  * Disabling the &quot;cache_dir rock&quot;. It seems to then take longer to
</I>&gt;<i>    appear, but does ultimately appear again.
</I>
Rock caches are not the only users of the transients queue. Memory cache
uses it as well.


HTH,

Alex.
