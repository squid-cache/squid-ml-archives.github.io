</I>
I was talking about a custom script that implements a custom DNS
resolver. With modern libraries, it takes a few lines of code to write a
basic one. This kind of resolver does not resolve most of the names, but
forwards queries to another/real resolver, adapting the queries and/or
the answers as needed.

For an oversimplified example, such a script can respond to all AAAA
queries (with answers containing no records) while forwarding all A
queries to a &quot;real&quot; resolver.

Eventually, Squid will support the logic you need internally, but that
requires development.

I do not even remember what custom-dns-program did exactly, but these
days Squid contains a built-in basic DNS client that talks to DNS
resolver(s) at the address(es) specified by the dns_nameservers directive.


HTH,
