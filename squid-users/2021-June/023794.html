To disable HTTPS access through the proxy, simply deny all CONNECT
requests using http_access rules.

Redirecting HTTPS attempts to HTTP is a lot harder and is unreliable.
You will have to bump TLS connections and then deny all bumped requests
with a redirection response (that many browsers may not even follow --
you should test this). This will not work in many cases because TLS is
not supposed to be bumped -- many clients and origin servers will work
hard to prevent you from bumping their connections. See ssl_bump and
deny_info for starting points.


HTH,

Alex.
