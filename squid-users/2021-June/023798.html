I would also comment on:

#http_access deny !Safe_ports

Has that been consciously and deliberately commented-out?

#http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

Is that a typo?  Did you mean to allow access from your local networks, rather 
than just from localhost?

#http_access deny all

Has that been consciously and deliberately commented-out?
