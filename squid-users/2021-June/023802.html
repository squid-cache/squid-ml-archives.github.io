I would strongly advise *against* commenting out:

http_access deny !Safe_ports
http_access deny all

Also, since you do not have (at least in the configuration file you showed us)

http_access allow localnet

I do not see how you expect any machine other than the one Squid is running on 
to be able to connect.

However, as in my last posting, please show us the configuration you are 
actually using to carry out these tests.
