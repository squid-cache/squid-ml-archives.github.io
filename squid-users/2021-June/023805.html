So, as Alex already said, the lines:

http_access allow all
http_access deny CONNECT

mean that anyone, from anyway, can connect.  That's it.

I recommend you turn this off now and hope your ISP doesn't block you for 
running an open proxy.

&gt;<i> here is a snippet (as the file is very large due,i can send full if you

No, please send us *only* the lines relating to a _single_ request which you 
think should have been blocked.

&gt;<i> the ip i tested from was 73.189.239.235
</I>
What!?

That is not even one of your listed IP addresses.

Are you *really* running an open proxy on the Internet!?

Please turn it off _now_ until you understand the advice Alex and I are giving 
you, and you understand the default settings in the standard Squid 
configuration file, some of which you have changed.


Antony.
