<PRE>Of course you could always just run your own web-based proxy such as these:
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=web+based+proxies">https://www.google.com/search?q=web+based+proxies</A> - that would fetch the
https site if necessary, and render it as http - but it will rarely be a
perfect copy.

I'm sure there are many other ways to do this too... again, what's your
real use case here?

&gt;<i> This seems all good and well if you're just proxying traffic to your own

</I>&gt;<i> sense any more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can block HTTPS through Squid, and even do some redirection with your
</I>&gt;<i> firewall too - but when it comes to whether it will work, your problem is
</I>&gt;<i> with the browsers - and everyone else on the internet: as a start, you
</I>&gt;<i> might want to read up on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security</A> - and
</I>&gt;<i> browser implementations. The only way to force HTTP, or to redirect to it,
</I>&gt;<i> is to compile and ship your own browsers too - and that would be a terrible
</I>&gt;<i> idea as anyone (on the planet) who found out that you have people using
</I>&gt;<i> such modified browsers, would be able to impersonate the sites they visited
</I>&gt;<i> and steal their credentials, in many cases without them knowing. This is
</I>&gt;<i> the actual problem that HTTPS and HSTS helps prevent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can install your own certificates and follow
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump</A> and then redirect to a
</I>&gt;<i> non-HTTPS page, but even so no up to date browser will obey the redirect if
</I>&gt;<i> HSTS is enabled for the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's caching you want to do, there was a time that you could cache
</I>&gt;<i> almost everything and emulate a 1Gbps connection on a 256kbps ADSL line...
</I>&gt;<i> but that time ended around 2010... we're now in 2021... it is now cheaper
</I>&gt;<i> and easier (esp. if you consider the cost of your time) than ever to just
</I>&gt;<i> build fast connections to the internet than ever before. Get yourself a
</I>&gt;<i> Starlink modem and share the connection - and costs - with your street, if
</I>&gt;<i> you're trying to save on bandwidth. I understand all about wanting to cache
</I>&gt;<i> things and run things offline and not having connectivity...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to cache content the proper way today, you will need to make
</I>&gt;<i> deals with the content providers you're trying to cache, and then set up
</I>&gt;<i> the infrastructure to host their content on your own server, and either get
</I>&gt;<i> them to issue you with SSL Certificates or point their DNS to you... or
</I>&gt;<i> easier, just connect to people who have already done this and already has
</I>&gt;<i> servers in a regional data center near you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, I guess you could mirror or spider some sites, and then
</I>&gt;<i> just host them on your non-HTTPS mirror. Likely against the wishes and
</I>&gt;<i> terms of those sites... but no proxy needed. But if you started messing
</I>&gt;<i> with a proxy and DNS in front of it, it would just break on all browsers
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better way to do it would be to write a browser addon that modifies the
</I>&gt;<i> URL to a custom url much like
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org">https://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org</A> does it by just having the
</I>&gt;<i> whole URL as the actual URL path... but why not just browse the Web Archive
</I>&gt;<i> directly then... bonus,* they run a Non-SSL version of the whole archive*!
</I>&gt;<i> No need to mess with anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's just a package repository you want to cache... it almost certainly
</I>&gt;<i> still has http support if you dig deeper... but you might want to enable
</I>&gt;<i> whatever hash checking mechanisms it has to save yourself some grey hairs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps if you shared your actual use case we could help you come up with
</I>&gt;<i> a better (and more responsible and sustainable) solution?
