My _guess_ now that I know Arctic 5824 is deliberately running an open web 
proxy on the Internet (with co-operation from the hosting provider or not) is 
that the objective is to convert all HTTPS connections into HTTP so that the 
content can be cached / scraped / captured on the way past, and the 
&quot;interesting bits&quot; used later, perhaps by some of Artic5824's &quot;customers&quot; 
without the people who chose to browse the Internet through an open proxy 
realising that this is even possible.

It's possibly even being advertised / promoted / sold as an &quot;anonymising 
service&quot;, where people can browse the sort of websites they would prefer not 
to do directly through their own connectivity providers, comfortable in the 
knowledge that the IP address hitting those sites is not theirs, but not 
realising that the HTTP traffic they are then using can be intercepted and 
examined not only by Artic5824 but also by their connectivity provider's 
transparent interception proxy.

I'd be happy to entertain any less dubious explanation of what the real 
purpose in setting up such a system might be.
