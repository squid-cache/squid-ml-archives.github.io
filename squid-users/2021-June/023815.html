Thanks for the warning, I dont think this will really be a problem for me though.


 1.  What makes you believe that sites have an HTTP version?

I dont see why they wouldnt, like sure they would prefer https but why would http not work if forced


2.  What do you think should happen when sites do have an HTTP version,  and that consists solely of a 301 Permanent Redirect to the HTTPS version

I didnt think of this, this would be a problem i guess, but I dont think it would be too common.

Maybe squid isnt the right software for this?
Thanks,
