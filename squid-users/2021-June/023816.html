Because this idea you have about changing advert content is not a
new thing.

It has been done and tried so many times in the past by others for
<A HREF="http://">http://</A> traffic that the major content providers whose income depended
on those ads got together and started a project to get rid of <A HREF="http://">http://</A>
completely. They have had much success with the support of privacy
and security advocate groups.

</I>&gt;<i> version,  and that consists solely of a 301 Permanent Redirect to the
</I>&gt;<i> HTTPS version

Reality is that today the vast majority of websites still offering
<A HREF="http://">http://</A> versions at all, do exactly that.

Squid is fine for the content adaptation part of what you are wanting.

What is not going to work is the HTTP-&gt;HTTP conversion part. That is
because of protocol and Browser features. No intermediary software can
get around those without the SSL-Bump (or similar) mechanism - as
others already mentioned that too has its limits. TLS is specifically
designed to prevent intermediaries touching the content - the only
reliable action a proxy can do is terminate unwanted TLS connections.
