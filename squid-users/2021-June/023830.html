A Squid bug would likely be later on.

Before we go any further. Which versino of Squid are you using.


&gt;<i> And it seems to work well. In detail :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say I have a account in my DB with: user1,password1,proxy1
</I>&gt;<i> As a client, I start my browser and connect myself with user1/password1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my helper log file, all is good and I can see that squid used the 
</I>&gt;<i> helper,
</I>&gt;<i> and it's answer was &quot;OK proxychoice=proxy1&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I switch from proxy1 to proxy2 for user1 in the database.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On my browser, I'm still authenticated as user1, and I'm still use 
</I>&gt;<i> proxy1.
</I>&gt;<i> (Ok, that's normal). Later, when the TTL is reached (2 minutes in the
</I>&gt;<i> configuration I sent),
</I>&gt;<i> I can see in my helper's log file that squid used it again. This time, 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> answer was : &quot;OK proxychoice=proxy2&quot;. So, all seems good here too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the routing did'nt change. The parent proxy used after 2 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> is still proxy1, and
</I>&gt;<i> it never change until I restart squid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to have better explain the problem. So you think there is a bug
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere,
</I>&gt;<i> or do we have a configuration problem ? How can we obtain the result
</I>&gt;<i> we are looking for ?
</I>&gt;<i> (Squid should change the parent proxy if needed after the
</I>&gt;<i> authentication TTL period).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You seem to think that user credentials are thrown away when they reach 
TTL. That is not true.

What actually happens is that shortly *before* TTL is reached they enter 
a grace period during which they will be refreshed using the helper. The 
info the helper provides is then used to *update* the existing 
credentials.

Also, the foo= annotations are additive by default. On more detailed 
inspection you will find the user has become &quot;proxy1&quot; *OR* &quot;proxy2&quot; 
allowed.



&gt;&gt;<i> Insufficient demand for that feature does not allow me to provide a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliable ETA at this time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a vague idea of the cost of the developement of this 
</I>&gt;<i> feature ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm not sure why Alex is offering a feature. A change to helper 
annotations was already implemented in Squid-5 to avoid this exact 
behaviour you are seeing.


&gt;<i> Thanks again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

FYI. The Squid-5 code already has the feature implemented. It is only 
the Squid-4 code which behaves like above.
