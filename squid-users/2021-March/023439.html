Obscurity is not equivalent to security.

I'm assuming this means your Squid proxy is accessible from the Internet.

Why?

What authentication method are you using?  At the very least, a user should 
not have to authenticate more than once per browser session - are they saying 
that even that is excessive?

&gt;<i> Is there any other solution than password protection that only authorized
</I>&gt;<i> users can have access to my squid server?
</I>
Depends what &quot;authorised&quot; means.  Can you define the network range they are 
expected to come from, and restrict access only to those IPs?

Tell about your network setup and what you are trying to achieve - we might be 
able to suggest solutions.
