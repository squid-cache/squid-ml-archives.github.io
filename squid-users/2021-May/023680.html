<PRE> As part of a teaching and learning (TaL)/school software, I need squid:

 a) to detect one of the connected computers in an internal network
comprising wirelessly connected and wired computers as the &quot;master&quot;
(operated by the teacher);

 b) when that master reach out to an outside URL, the response should
be replicated in that master's and all other internal computers; but

 c) responses to requests originating in the non master (&quot;slave&quot;?)
ends, return to their corresponding ends;

 d) at times the master should be able to switch off that replicating feature;

 e) more than one or all computers should be able to play &quot;master&quot;;

 f) all other &quot;slave&quot; should operate in a &quot;transparent proxy&quot; mode;

 g) on a single computer, someone could use different
browsers/versions to do a-f ...

 I have seen that partially implemented one way or the other, however
I need to integrate/manage all parts as part of an integrated whole.

 I could imagine these kinds of setups being used in TaL and
conferencing environments, as well as in testing environments and, for
example, &#167;a could be achieved with the mac address and/or cookies, but
someone could run macchanger and delete all cookies in their browser,
so an extra authentication barrier should be used, which I see as the
only fool proof way of setup and know who the masters are, or? How
could disable slave ends from authenticating? I am not a networking
kind of guy, so I am not quite sure about the kind of scenarios that
could play out in those kinds of dynamic &quot;master&quot;/&quot;slaves&quot; setups.

 Probably, all the functional requirements relating to what I have
described can not straight-forwardly done with squid, but there should
be a way to use other applications' output to dynamically reconfigure:

 /etc/squid/squid.conf

 So, my questions could be reduced to: which exactly are the
configuration lines that should be changed in both squid and the
browsers on the connected computers or the different browsers in the
same computer?
