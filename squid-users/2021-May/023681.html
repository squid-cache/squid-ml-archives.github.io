What information is available to Squid in order to &quot;detect&quot; that this is the

What do you mean by &quot;the response should be replicated in ... all other 
internal computers&quot;?

Are you assuming that these computers are already running a browser, and that 
they should suddenly get some (apparently) web server response via Squid and 
display it, even though they did not make any request?

If so, I would say this is impossible - you can't get a computer to show a 
response to a request it did not make.

If I have misunderstood, please explain which this does mean.

&gt;<i>  c) responses to requests originating in the non master (&quot;slave&quot;?)
</I>&gt;<i> ends, return to their corresponding ends;
</I>
So, any computer other than the &quot;master&quot; simply makes requests and gets 
standard responses as usual.  Fie.

&gt;<i>  d) at times the master should be able to switch off that replicating
</I>&gt;<i> feature;
</I>
What times?  How?  I really think you need to explain this &quot;replicating 
feature&quot; in more detail (and preferably in network terms, from the point of 
view of the software running on the master, and the software running on a non-
master.

&gt;<i>  e) more than one or all computers should be able to play &quot;master&quot;;
</I>
I repeat my first question - what information is available to Squid in order to 
&quot;detect&quot; that this is the &quot;master&quot; machine?

&gt;<i>  f) all other &quot;slave&quot; should operate in a &quot;transparent proxy&quot; mode;
</I>
Are you including SSL in this?

&gt;<i>  g) on a single computer, someone could use different
</I>&gt;<i> browsers/versions to do a-f ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I have seen that partially implemented one way or the other, however
</I>&gt;<i> I need to integrate/manage all parts as part of an integrated whole.
</I>

&gt;<i>  So, my questions could be reduced to: which exactly are the
</I>&gt;<i> configuration lines that should be changed in both squid and the
</I>&gt;<i> browsers on the connected computers or the different browsers in the
</I>&gt;<i> same computer?
</I>
I think this request is (a) a *lot* more complicated than this, and probably a 
lot more complicated than you think it is, and (b) in parts, impossible.

Antony.
