 Well, yes that I see. I ask here because the most important part of
what I have in mind is squid in tandem with an ICAP plugin, so you
should know best about technologies around it. I am not asking for you
to do such thing or change the design of squid for me.

&gt;&gt;<i> Probably, all the functional requirements relating to what I have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/squid/squid.conf
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, my questions could be reduced to: which exactly are the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>browsers on the connected computers or the different browsers in the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this apaprently means that all squid caches running on their machines will

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> note that intercepting HTTPS (port 443) is much more work and issues than
</I>&gt;<i> port 80 (http).
</I>
 I was actually thinking in terms of some sort of &quot;squid caching
sessions&quot; instead of having squid running on all local machines, but I
have to think more about why you have suggested such a solution (or
possibly misinterpreted my idea)
