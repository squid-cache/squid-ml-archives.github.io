I've returned to your original question here, after discussing several points 
already in some detail, and I can't help wondering - why are you trying to do 
all this in browsers and web proxies, by manipulating network communications 
in ways that were not indended?

Why not give the students a video conferencing / screen sharing application 
such as MS Teams, Jitsi, Zoom, etc and then block them from accessing websites 
during lessons?

They are required to use the screen sharing application in order to see what 
the teacher is showing them during the lesson (are the days of video 
projectors and intelligent whiteboards already over?), and they are not 
allowed to play around on their own (are these devices their own personal 
equipment, or are they supplied and managed by the school?) using the school's 
networking resources.

That would seem to me to be a far simpler solution to your requirement, 
assuming I have now correctly understood that you essentially want a teacher 
to share their screen with the students, and for the students not to be able 
to &quot;wander off on their own&quot; into the general Internet.
