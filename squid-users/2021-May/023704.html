There is no one &quot;standard way&quot; to deploy such versatile software like
Squid: Some deployments bump as much as they can while caching nothing.
Some encrypt everything and cache a lot. There are forward/interception
proxies versus reverse proxies. SaaS proxies versus highly customized
corporate deployments versus in-home installations. Deployments that
contribute a lot to the Squid Project versus those that we have never
heard of. And everything in between.

In most cases, the &quot;standard&quot; does not really matter. Focus on _your_
needs and make sure they can be and are supported well.

Alex.
