AFAICT from your summary, &quot;moved to cloud&quot; here means that the API
protocol stays the same, the API server domain name stays the same, the
API URL path stays the same, but the IP address of that domain name will
change. Please clarify if that conclusion is wrong.

If it is correct, then it is not clear how the change of an IP address
would affect those making API requests using the domain name, and what
role Squid is playing here.

Alex.
