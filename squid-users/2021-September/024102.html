To build on Alex's good question, are the API client's sending the API 
calls /through/ Squid?  Or are they configured to bypass Squid?

The mechanism the client's use seems extremely germane here.  E.g. if 
the client's are configured to bypass the proxy for fred.mydomain.com. 
Or if client's use Squid and Squid has been configured to access 
fred.mydomain.com on behalf of clients, and how.

We need more information to be able to say anything meaningful, much 
less helpful.
