Are you going to re-configure the clients to use the new / different 
name?  Or do you need to re-configure either the intermediate Squid or 
the target; Fred, also running squid, to translate from the old API 
hostname to the new / different hostname?

&gt;<i> I need a squid server configuration that will just forward the api

</I>
Are there two Squid servers in play now that Fred is running Squid?

Is there a proxy server, Squid or otherwise, between clients and Fred? 
Or is Fred the Squid server that you were referencing in your emails?

&gt;<i> Long story short I just need a pass through squid server.
</I>
I suspect you might need to do more than simply pass the requests 
through.  It sounds to me like you need to translates requests for 
<A HREF="https://fred.mydomain.com/api/event">https://fred.mydomain.com/api/event</A> to <A HREF="https://dmz.mydomain.com/api/event.">https://dmz.mydomain.com/api/event.</A>

It seems to me like you are going to want to configure Squid on Fred to 
act as a Reverse Proxy (Accelerator).
