Will those internal servers trust the certificate you configure Squid
with? In your example, you used &quot;<A HREF="https://...">https://...</A>&quot;. That usually means the
internal servers are going to validate the server certificate. Can you
make them trust the Squid certificate? Or does the API communication
have to be signed by a fred.mydomain.com certificate that you do not
control?

The other pending question is whether those internal servers are
configured to use a proxy (see the previous email on this thread) or
always talk directly to (what they think is) the API service?

Alex.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     AFAICT from your summary, &quot;moved to cloud&quot; here means that the API
