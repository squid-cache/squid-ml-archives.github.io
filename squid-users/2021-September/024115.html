Your use of &quot;redirect&quot; sounds like you will be re-configuring the 
clients to connect to the squid server.

Will you be configuring the clients to know that they are using a proxy 
server?  Or will you be using some sort of transparent and / or reverse 
proxy?

</I>
What does &quot;redirect&quot; mean in this context?

It sounds like you mean a reverse proxy.  --  Which is what I've given 
you links to documentation for.

Reading between the lines, the client's won't have access to the 
Internet.  So, something like a 301 / 302 / 307 / 308 HTTP redirect 
won't do much good by themselves.

You need to clearly articulate the following:

1)  Are the clients configured to knowingly use a proxy?
      - The communications protocol they use is slightly different.
2)  What hostname are the client's connecting to?
3)  What protocol(s) are the client's using to connect to said hostname?
4)  Is TLS being used on any part of the connection?
5)  What hostname is Squid supposed to connect to?
6)  Will any part of the API URL change /other/ /than/ the hostname?

These six questions have subtle but distinct interaction with each other.
