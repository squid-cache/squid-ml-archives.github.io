Exactly so. I am endorsing a cautious attempt to upgrade (for now).

</I>
With that disclaimer &quot;not present in squid-4&quot; I can say yes.

My uncertainty is about as-yet unknown issues. All the fixes introduced 
by 5.4.1 appear to be stable and working.


&gt;<i> For example, are the memory leaks fixed?  That isn't clear to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As for leaks; we have fixed several. At least one remains in v5+, I am 
unsure at this point whether it affects everyone or just specific 
configurations.

There are quite a few bugs to be worked out still, but they appear to be 
low-impact or restricted to very specific configurations.
