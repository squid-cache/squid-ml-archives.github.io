It is a very difficult topic. The best documentation that I know about 
(and it is not very good) is squid.conf.documented and
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>

I bet that whatever it is that slows your Squid down, it is not the 
number of listening ports (i.e. what I presume you call &quot;IPs&quot;): AFAIK, 
when handling traffic, Squid does not iterate over listening ports so 
the number of listening ports should not affect Squid runtime 
performance much.


&gt;<i> Its a shame that does not exist a team or even a guy that sells squid 
</I>&gt;<i> services/support now a days to implement squid features.
</I>
FWIW, several companies and individuals offer paid Squid support. 
Unfortunately, the Squid Project effectively stopped maintaining the 
list of those support shops, and Google is unable to find the right 
pages in my quick test, but they are out there.


&gt;<i> Even with my almost 30 years working with IT infrastructure its hard to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with squid alone.
</I>
I agree!


Good luck,

Alex.
