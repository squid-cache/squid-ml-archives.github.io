<PRE>Gotcha - I'll upgrade to 5 shortly, but I don't think that's affecting my
confusion.

Thanks for your nitpick, I think it's actually part of the key. I followed
your suggestion, trying the parent cache_peer just on http, with the
following squid.conf.

http_port 80 accel
cache_peer 10.60.4.178 parent 3128 0 no-query no-digest name=forward
request_header_add Joel Joel

# Simplified acl
http_access allow all
cache_peer_access forward allow all

# Misc
shutdown_lifetime 1 seconds
debug_options ALL,6

I upped the log level and followed how squid transformed the request, and
saw it change

GET / to
GET its-own-hostname/

based on the Host header on the incoming request, as you pointed out.

The first problem is, the parent proxy doesn't know how to resolve that
host - it rejects the request with &quot;Invalid URL&quot;. I need the reverse proxy
to rewrite both the host header and url to their correct target values for
the parent proxy.

I tested this via telnet to the parent proxy (since I'm still struggling to
get squid url rewriting working, will try that more later). When I sent

GET <A HREF="http://target-hostname/">http://target-hostname/</A> HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Accept: */*
Host: target-hostname
Via: 1.1 ip-10-60-4-103 (squid/3.5.27)
Surrogate-Capability: ip-10-60-4-103=&quot;Surrogate/1.0 ESI/1.0&quot;
X-Forwarded-For: 10.40.0.194
Cache-Control: max-age=259200
Connection: keep-alive
Joel: Joel

it works, but if I try https I get &quot;Unsupported Request Method and
Protocol&quot; (it so happens that the parent proxy is also a squid in this
case). I think this is expected, as the request above (https from proxy to
proxy, on behalf of http client) should have been a CONNECT followed by the
GET once the tunnel was established.

So: is squid capable of receiving the GET / to itself, sending a CONNECT
/target-hostname to the parent proxy, negotiating that connection and then
returning the result to the client? Obviously when it's functioning as a
forward proxy it can *receive* CONNECTs and handle them, but this is the
&quot;flip&quot; I'm still struggling with.

Thanks so much for your time, I'm learning this as I go and you've been
very helpful.
