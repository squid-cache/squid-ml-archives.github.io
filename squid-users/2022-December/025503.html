</I>
I am not sure what you mean by &quot;global effect&quot;. The ssl_bump directive 
affects transactions that are received on ports marked with an 
&quot;ssl-bump&quot; option and only them.


&gt;<i> and also imply &#8220;http_access allow&#8221; 
</I>
There is no such implication. In fact, conflating ssl_bump rules and 
HTTP-level access controls is a common configuration mistake. Correct 
configurations treat those two areas separately.

The only case where one could see a legitimate intersection of SslBump 
and access-controls is an &quot;ssl_bump terminate&quot; rule that triggers TCP 
connection(s) closure. One can view that termination as a form of access 
control (at TCP rather than HTTP level) -- http_access rules are not 
evaluated after Squid closes the connections, of course. In all other 
cases, http_access rules are evaluated after every ssl_bump rules scan.

&gt;<i> making it difficult isolate access. To get around this I thought 
</I>&gt;<i> to simply skip ssl decrypt for the traffic with verified headers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> acl Repo_Skip_HDR req_header Repo_Svr_VerifiedHdr True
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ssl_bump none Repo_Skip_HDR
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately even this isn&#8217;t working, again the config checks out and 
</I>&gt;<i> runs happily, we see the header in the logs, but squid still tries to 
</I>&gt;<i> inspect the traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on why ssl_bump would ignore the header ACL or other 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions to isolate traffic when being required to skip ssl decrypt 
</I>&gt;<i> would be greatly appreciated.
</I>
SslBump acts on the first applicable matching rule. It sounds like your 
(unsupported legacy) &quot;none&quot; rule is located below some other ssl_bump 
rules that are applicable to the current SslBump step and that match at 
least once. For more information, see 
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice</A>
  You can (indirectly and partially) test that theory by making the 
ssl_bump &quot;none&quot; rule the very first ssl_bump rule in the entire Squid 
configuration. Assuming all CONNECT requests have the right headers, 
that ssl_bump &quot;none&quot; rule should match as appropriate, and Squid should 
establish a blind TCP tunnel instead of doing TLS.

In modern configurations, the correct action is &quot;splice&quot;, not &quot;none&quot;. 
The above SslPeekAndSplice page documents the difference.


HTH,

Alex.
