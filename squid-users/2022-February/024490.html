<PRE>Hey Alex,

If there are a lot more requests than your users/TTLs should generate,
&gt;<i> then you may be able to decrease db load by figuring out where the extra
</I>&gt;<i> requests are coming from.
</I>

actually, I don't think it matters much now that I think about it again,
since as per my requirements,
I need to reload the cache every 60 seconds, which means that even if it is
perfect, MariaDB will still
get a high load. I think the second approach will be better suited.

and/or adding database
&gt;<i> power (e.g., by introducing additional databases running on previously
</I>&gt;<i> unused hardware -- just like your MariaDB idea).
</I>

That is an excellent point,  I think I will work on a central connection
aggregator as you suggested,
and also put in more DB power via Redis on K8S. This way it will best fast
and scale automatically.

aggregating helper-db connections (helpers can be written to
&gt;<i> talk through a central connection aggregator)
</I>

 That sounds like exactly what I am looking for, how would one go about
doing this?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; username and password, the scripts are written in Python.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been facing an issue, that when under load, the helpers (even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with 3600 sec TTL) swamp the MariaDB instance, causing it to reach 100%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CPU, basically I believe because each helper opens up its own connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to MariaDB, which ends up as a lot of connections.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My initial idea was to create a Redis DB next to each Squid instance and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connect each Squid to its own dedicated Redis. I will sync Redis with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MariaDB every minute, thus decreasing the connections count from a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 100s to just 1 every minute. This will also improve speeds since Redis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is much faster than MariaDB.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is, however, that there will still be many connections from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Squid to Redis, and I probably that will consume a lot of DB resources
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as well, which I don't actually know how to optimize, since it seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that Squid opens many processes, and there is no way to get them to talk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to each other (expect TTL values, which seems not to help in my case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which I also don't understand why that is).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the best practice to handle this? considering I have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     1. Fast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     2. Refresh data every minute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     3. Consume as least amount of DB resources as possible
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would start from the beginning: Does the aggregate number of database
</I>&gt;<i> requests match your expectations? In other words, do you see lots of
</I>&gt;<i> database requests that should not be there given your user access
</I>&gt;<i> patterns and authentication TTLs? In yet other words, are there many
</I>&gt;<i> repeated authentication accesses that should have been authentication
</I>&gt;<i> cache hits?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are a lot more requests than your users/TTLs should generate,
</I>&gt;<i> then you may be able to decrease db load by figuring out where the extra
</I>&gt;<i> requests are coming from. For example, it is possible that your
</I>&gt;<i> authentication cache key includes some noise that renders caching
</I>&gt;<i> ineffective (e.g., see comments about key_extras in
</I>&gt;<i> squid.conf.documented). Or maybe you need a bigger authentication cache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the total stream of authentication requests during peak hours is
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable, with few unwarranted cache misses, then you can start
</I>&gt;<i> working on aggregating helper-db connections (helpers can be written to
</I>&gt;<i> talk through a central connection aggregator) and/or adding database
</I>&gt;<i> power (e.g., by introducing additional databases running on previously
</I>&gt;<i> unused hardware -- just like your MariaDB idea).
</I>&gt;<i>
