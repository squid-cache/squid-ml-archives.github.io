Your call. Wiping out the entire authentication cache every 60 seconds 
feels odd, but I do not know enough about your environment to judge.


&gt;<i> Alex: aggregating helper-db connections (helpers can be written to
</I>&gt;<i>       talk through a central connection aggregator)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> That sounds like exactly what I am looking for, how would one go about 
</I>&gt;<i> doing this?
</I>
You have at least two basic options:

A. Enhance Squid to let SMP workers share helpers. I assume that you 
have C SMP workers and N helpers per worker, with C and N significantly 
greater than 1. Instead of having N helpers per worker and C*N helpers 
total, you will have just one concurrent helper per worker and C helpers 
total. This will be a significant, generally useful improvement that 
should be officially accepted if implemented well. This enhancement 
requires serious Squid code modifications in a neglected error-prone 
area, but it is certainly doable -- Squid already shares rock diskers 
across workers, for example.

B. Convert your helper from a database client program to an Aggregator 
client program (and write the Aggregator). Depending on your needs and 
skill, you can use TCP or Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for 
helper-Aggregator communication. The Aggregator may look very similar to 
the current helper, except it will not use stdin/stdout for 
receiving/sending helper queries/responses. This option also requires 
development, but it is much simpler than option A.


HTH,

Alex.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; I have been facing an issue, that when under load, the helpers (even

</I>&gt;<i>     connection
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; to MariaDB, which ends up as a lot of connections.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; My initial idea was to create a Redis DB next to each Squid
</I>&gt;<i>     instance and
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; connect each Squid to its own dedicated Redis. I will sync Redis
</I>&gt;<i>     with
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; MariaDB every minute, thus decreasing the connections count from
</I>&gt;<i>     a few
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; 100s to just 1 every minute. This will also improve speeds since
</I>&gt;<i>     Redis
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; is much faster than MariaDB.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; The problem is, however, that there will still be many
</I>&gt;<i>     connections from
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Squid to Redis, and I probably that will consume a lot of DB
</I>&gt;<i>     resources
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; as well, which I don't actually know how to optimize, since it seems
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; that Squid opens many processes, and there is no way to get them
</I>&gt;<i>     to talk
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; to each other (expect TTL values, which seems not to help in my
</I>&gt;<i>     case,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; which I also don't understand why that is).
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; What is the best practice to handle this? considering I have the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; following requirements:
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;1. Fast
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;2. Refresh data every minute
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;3. Consume as least amount of DB resources as possible
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I would start from the beginning: Does the aggregate number of database
</I>&gt;<i>     requests match your expectations? In other words, do you see lots of
</I>&gt;<i>     database requests that should not be there given your user access
</I>&gt;<i>     patterns and authentication TTLs? In yet other words, are there many
</I>&gt;<i>     repeated authentication accesses that should have been authentication
</I>&gt;<i>     cache hits?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If there are a lot more requests than your users/TTLs should generate,
</I>&gt;<i>     then you may be able to decrease db load by figuring out where the
</I>&gt;<i>     extra
</I>&gt;<i>     requests are coming from. For example, it is possible that your
</I>&gt;<i>     authentication cache key includes some noise that renders caching
</I>&gt;<i>     ineffective (e.g., see comments about key_extras in
</I>&gt;<i>     squid.conf.documented). Or maybe you need a bigger authentication cache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If the total stream of authentication requests during peak hours is
</I>&gt;<i>     reasonable, with few unwarranted cache misses, then you can start
</I>&gt;<i>     working on aggregating helper-db connections (helpers can be written to
</I>&gt;<i>     talk through a central connection aggregator) and/or adding database
</I>&gt;<i>     power (e.g., by introducing additional databases running on previously
</I>&gt;<i>     unused hardware -- just like your MariaDB idea).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
