With this approach (let's call it C), you will have as many database 
clients as there are workers in your Squid instance, just like in option 
A. Option C is probably a lot easier to implement for a given helper 
than the generic option A. Option B gives you one database client per 
Squid instance.

It is not clear to me why C parallelizes reading/writing from/to 
stdin/stdout -- I doubt that task is the bottleneck in your environment. 
I would expect a single stdin reader thread and a single stdout writer 
thread instead.

This is not my area of expertise, but if you do go option C route, you 
may need to protect helper's stdin/stdout descriptors with a mutex so 
that threads can read/write from/to stdin/stdout without getting 
mangled/partial reads and mangled/overlapping writes.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; That sounds like exactly what I am looking for, how would one go
</I>&gt;<i>     about
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; doing this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     You have at least two basic options:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A. Enhance Squid to let SMP workers share helpers. I assume that you
</I>&gt;<i>     have C SMP workers and N helpers per worker, with C and N significantly
</I>&gt;<i>     greater than 1. Instead of having N helpers per worker and C*N helpers
</I>&gt;<i>     total, you will have just one concurrent helper per worker and C
</I>&gt;<i>     helpers
</I>&gt;<i>     total. This will be a significant, generally useful improvement that
</I>&gt;<i>     should be officially accepted if implemented well. This enhancement
</I>&gt;<i>     requires serious Squid code modifications in a neglected error-prone
</I>&gt;<i>     area, but it is certainly doable -- Squid already shares rock diskers
</I>&gt;<i>     across workers, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     B. Convert your helper from a database client program to an Aggregator
</I>&gt;<i>     client program (and write the Aggregator). Depending on your needs and
</I>&gt;<i>     skill, you can use TCP or Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for
</I>&gt;<i>     helper-Aggregator communication. The Aggregator may look very
</I>&gt;<i>     similar to
</I>&gt;<i>     the current helper, except it will not use stdin/stdout for
</I>&gt;<i>     receiving/sending helper queries/responses. This option also requires
</I>&gt;<i>     development, but it is much simpler than option A.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     HTH,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; I have been facing an issue, that when under load, the
</I>&gt;<i>     helpers (even
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; with 3600 sec TTL) swamp the MariaDB instance, causing&#160;it to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;reach 100%
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; CPU, basically&#160;I believe because each helper opens up its own
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;connection
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; to MariaDB, which ends up as a lot of connections.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; My initial idea was to create a Redis DB next to each Squid
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;instance and
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; connect each Squid to its own dedicated Redis. I will sync
</I>&gt;<i>     Redis
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;with
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; MariaDB every minute, thus decreasing the connections
</I>&gt;<i>     count from
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;a few
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; 100s to just 1 every minute. This will also improve speeds
</I>&gt;<i>     since
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;Redis
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; is much faster than MariaDB.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; The problem is, however, that there will still be many
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;connections from
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; Squid to Redis, and I probably that will consume a lot of DB
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;resources
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; as well, which I don't actually know how to optimize,
</I>&gt;<i>     since it seems
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; that Squid opens many processes, and there is no way to
</I>&gt;<i>     get them
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;to talk
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; to each other (expect TTL values, which seems not to help
</I>&gt;<i>     in my
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;case,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; which I also don't understand why that is).
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; What is the best practice to handle this? considering I
</I>&gt;<i>     have the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; following requirements:
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;1. Fast
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;2. Refresh data every minute
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;3. Consume as least amount of DB resources as possible
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;I would start from the beginning: Does the aggregate number
</I>&gt;<i>     of database
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;requests match your expectations? In other words, do you see
</I>&gt;<i>     lots of
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;database requests that should not be there given your user access
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;patterns and authentication TTLs? In yet other words, are
</I>&gt;<i>     there many
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;repeated authentication accesses that should have been
</I>&gt;<i>     authentication
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;cache hits?
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;If there are a lot more requests than your users/TTLs should
</I>&gt;<i>     generate,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;then you may be able to decrease db load by figuring out
</I>&gt;<i>     where the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;extra
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;requests are coming from. For example, it is possible that your
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;authentication cache key includes some noise that renders caching
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;ineffective (e.g., see comments about key_extras in
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;squid.conf.documented). Or maybe you need a bigger
</I>&gt;<i>     authentication cache.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;If the total stream of authentication requests during peak
</I>&gt;<i>     hours is
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;reasonable, with few unwarranted cache misses, then you can start
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;working on aggregating helper-db connections (helpers can be
</I>&gt;<i>     written to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;talk through a central connection aggregator) and/or adding
</I>&gt;<i>     database
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;power (e.g., by introducing additional databases running on
</I>&gt;<i>     previously
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;unused hardware -- just like your MariaDB idea).
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;Cheers,
