Ah, thank you for that clarification. It addresses most of my earlier 
concerns. Ideally, you want four functions AFAICT:

1. stdin reader
2. stdout writer
3. answer generator
4. db updater

I agree that you can join 1+3 (or 2+3) together, but you are sacrificing 
some parallelism if you join. Whether that sacrifice is important or 
not, depends on various local factors.


&gt;<i> Then, when a new std request comes in, the std handler&#160;will simply read 
</I>&gt;<i> from that variable, instead of from the DB.
</I>
Yes, and pass the answer to the stdout writing thread/function.


&gt;<i> I see the following benefits&#160;in this approach:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1. We will have only&#160;one DB connection every 60 seconds, per Squid
</I>&gt;<i>     worker instance.
</I>
Yes, one per Squid worker. Hopefully, 60 seconds (divided by the number 
of workers if the database cannot parallelize these &quot;give me everything&quot; 
queries) will be enough to receive (the relevant portion of) the database.


&gt;<i>     2. It will be very fast since the std handler will simply read from
</I>&gt;<i>     a local variable.
</I>
Yes, assuming the query is simple and/or the database is small.


&gt;<i>     you will have as many database
</I>&gt;<i>     clients as there are workers in your Squid instance
</I>
&gt;<i> You are definitely&#160;right, but as this will be much faster I think I will 
</I>&gt;<i> be able to decrease my number of workers significantly.
</I>
Whether you can decrease the number of Squid workers depends on where 
the bottlenecks are. If your Squid workers are mostly idle now, then 
yes, you will be able to decrease their number (but you can do that even 
without helper rewrites then AFAICT).


&gt;<i> Also, we might be able to use concurrency=n here to decrease&#160;it further?
</I>
Yes, probably. Even with just one helper thread/function answering 
helper queries, giving Squid the ability to submit the next query 
without waiting for the answer to the previous one will parallelize I/O 
across the helper/Squid boundary, which is a good thing.


Cheers,

Alex.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; It will require no extra DBs and no tweaks to Squid, but maybe I am

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     With this approach (let's call it C), you will have as many database

</I>&gt;<i>     option

</I>&gt;<i>     than the generic option A. Option B gives you one database client per
</I>&gt;<i>     Squid instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It is not clear to me why C parallelizes reading/writing from/to

</I>&gt;<i>     environment.
</I>&gt;<i>     I would expect a single stdin reader thread and a single stdout writer

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This is not my area of expertise, but if you do go option C route, you
</I>&gt;<i>     may need to protect helper's stdin/stdout descriptors with a mutex so

</I>&gt;<i>     mangled/partial reads and mangled/overlapping writes.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; That sounds like exactly what I am looking for, how would
</I>&gt;<i>     one go
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;about
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; doing this?
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;You have at least two basic options:
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;A. Enhance Squid to let SMP workers share helpers. I assume
</I>&gt;<i>     that you
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;have C SMP workers and N helpers per worker, with C and N
</I>&gt;<i>     significantly
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;greater than 1. Instead of having N helpers per worker and
</I>&gt;<i>     C*N helpers
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;total, you will have just one concurrent helper per worker and C
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;helpers
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;total. This will be a significant, generally useful
</I>&gt;<i>     improvement that
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;should be officially accepted if implemented well. This
</I>&gt;<i>     enhancement
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;requires serious Squid code modifications in a neglected
</I>&gt;<i>     error-prone
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;area, but it is certainly doable -- Squid already shares rock
</I>&gt;<i>     diskers
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;across workers, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;B. Convert your helper from a database client program to an
</I>&gt;<i>     Aggregator
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;client program (and write the Aggregator). Depending on your
</I>&gt;<i>     needs and
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;skill, you can use TCP or Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;helper-Aggregator communication. The Aggregator may look very
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;similar to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;the current helper, except it will not use stdin/stdout for
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;receiving/sending helper queries/responses. This option also
</I>&gt;<i>     requires
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;development, but it is much simpler than option A.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; to MariaDB, which ends up as a lot of connections.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; My initial idea was to create a Redis DB next to

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;instance and

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;Redis
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;with
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; MariaDB every minute, thus decreasing the connections

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;a few
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; 100s to just 1 every minute. This will also improve

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;since

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; is much faster than MariaDB.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; The problem is, however, that there will still be many

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt; Squid to Redis, and I probably that will consume a

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;If there are a lot more requests than your users/TTLs
</I>&gt;<i>     should
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;generate,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;then you may be able to decrease db load by figuring out
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;where the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;extra
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;requests are coming from. For example, it is possible
</I>&gt;<i>     that your
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;authentication cache key includes some noise that
</I>&gt;<i>     renders caching
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;ineffective (e.g., see comments about key_extras in
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;squid.conf.documented). Or maybe you need a bigger
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;authentication cache.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;If the total stream of authentication requests during peak
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;hours is
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;reasonable, with few unwarranted cache misses, then
</I>&gt;<i>     you can start
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;working on aggregating helper-db connections (helpers
</I>&gt;<i>     can be
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;written to

</I>&gt;<i>     adding
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;database
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;power (e.g., by introducing additional databases

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160; &gt;&#160; &#160; &#160;unused hardware -- just like your MariaDB idea).
