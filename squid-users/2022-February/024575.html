At this point I should remind that it is a *wiki* and largely written by 
all of us in the community.

The ConfigExamples section a collection of configs that people here in 
the community are (or were) actively using and found useful to share.
We (the main devs) have made a point of trying to update the contents to 
prune mistakes and mention when there are Squid version-specific 
differences. That is all.

That said, Francesco is working on converting the wiki content to 
another format so right now is not good for edits.


&gt;<i> I think one of the most important things to have with examples is meta 
</I>&gt;<i> information about the configuration (both server and client side) that

Sounds like you are talking about 
&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS</A>&gt;. From that page it is a 
matter of selecting which situation is the use-case and diving into the 
rabbit hole of links.


&gt;<i> /Just/ having configuration examples doesn't do much in and of itself 
</I>&gt;<i> without knowing the context the examples are from.&#160; If anything /just/ 
</I>&gt;<i> examples is worse in that people have no context and are left with 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to identify the version, what was being and intended to be done, 
</I>&gt;<i> and then translating that to the version &amp; configuration they are 
</I>&gt;<i> working with.&#160; This is something that's non-trivial for seasoned (Squid) 
</I>&gt;<i> administrators and can be near impossible to new (Squid) administrators.
