Okay, that makes good sense.

&gt;<i> We're wanting to use the https inspect feature of the firewall,
</I>
Please give more details?

 - What sort of firewall is this?
 - What does &quot;HTTPS inspect&quot; actually mean?
 - How does the firewall &quot;inspect&quot; HTTPS traffic, which by design is encrypted 
between client and server (neither of which is the firewall)?
 - What does &quot;inspect&quot; mean?  What information is revealed from the inspection 
of the encrypted communication?

&gt;<i> but according to our firewall documentation it appears due to the location of
</I>&gt;<i> our proxy servers we would be unable to do so.
</I>
Why?  Where would the proxy servers need to be instead, in order for this 
inspection to work?

Alternatively, how does/would it work if the proxy were not there, and clients 
communicated directly to the Internet through the firewall?

&gt;<i> My question is, if the proxy is behaving as a MITM between itself and
</I>&gt;<i> the client, can't the Firewall do the same thing between itself and the
</I>&gt;<i> proxy?
</I>
I agree.  Have you asked the suppliers / authors / vendors of the firewall?

&gt;<i> I suspect it is possible, but might potentially involve a lot of headaches
</I>&gt;<i> and a big hit on performance?
</I>
Who knows?

If it's the firewall telling you there's a problem, this doesn't entirely feel 
like a Squid question.
