<PRE>Hey Antony,

Thanks for the quick response.

&gt;<i> - What sort of firewall is this?
</I>
The firewall is a Cisco FTDv 6.6.

&gt;<i>   - What does &quot;HTTPS inspect&quot; actually mean?
</I>&gt;<i>   - How does the firewall &quot;inspect&quot; HTTPS traffic, which by design is encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> between client and server (neither of which is the firewall)?
</I>&gt;<i>   - What does &quot;inspect&quot; mean?  What information is revealed from the inspection
</I>&gt;<i> of the encrypted communication?
</I>
It's doing something they call 'decrypt and resign'. Similar to how 
ssl_bump works, so would putting the firewall certificate on the Squid 
server's trusted certificates source be enough?

&gt;<i> Why?  Where would the proxy servers need to be instead, in order for this
</I>&gt;<i> inspection to work?
</I>
Good question, their documentation says the following:

    HTTP proxy limitation

    The system cannot decrypt traffic if an HTTP proxy is positioned
    between a client and your managed device, and the client and server
    establish a tunneled TLS/SSL connection using the CONNECT HTTP
    method. The Handshake Errors undecryptable action determines how the
    system handles this traffic.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, how does/would it work if the proxy were not there, and clients
</I>&gt;<i> communicated directly to the Internet through the firewall?
</I>
If the proxy wasn't there, it looks like it works the same as ssl_bump.

&gt;<i> Have you asked the suppliers / authors / vendors of the firewall?
</I>
Not yet but I will be doing so today.

&gt;<i> If it's the firewall telling you there's a problem, this doesn't entirely feel
</I>&gt;<i> like a Squid question.
</I>
Okay, what if we removed the firewall and replaced it with another squid proxy server, where that is also doing ssl_bump. I assume this would work but are there negative implications of doing so?

Appreciate you taking the time.

Thanks,

Will
