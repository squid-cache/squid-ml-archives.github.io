Does that means 1 CPU core?
  What speed CPU?

What &quot;mode&quot; of proxy is this Squid operating as?


&gt;<i> Any tunning the I need to perform on kernel, sysctl or proc files?

The number of connections does not matter much unfortunately. What 
matters is how many requests are being made on those connections, and 
how fast they arrive.

90k connections over a day with one request each is trivial. A single 
connection delivering a million requests in one minute is a major 
problem. Your reality will be somewhere in between.

If you are able to gather network statistics to find out the 
request-per-second traffic rates happening in your traffic do that and 
we can use those numbers more helpfully.

If not, then the best thing to do is simply setup Squid how you want to 
use it and see what happens. At the very least it can provide you those 
numbers for fine tuning once it is already operational.

FYI; Tuning is an ongoing process as popularity of websites and the 
technology they are built from changes relatively often. So the &quot;same&quot; 
traffic will change over time and tuning will need irregular updates.
