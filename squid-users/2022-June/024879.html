Why did you change the recommended 92 days into 91?

Consider June, July and August:

	June has 30 days
	July has 31 days
	August has 31 days

So, on September 1st, June 1st is 92 days ago, and you can delete the logs for 
May 31st, which are older than 92 days.

If you deleted older than 91 days, you would be deleting June 1st on September 
1st, and one day this might be significant to someone.
