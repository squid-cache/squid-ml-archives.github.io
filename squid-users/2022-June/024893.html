<PRE>Hey Matus,

The Squid-Cache project to my knowledge doesn't have a developer expert or have enough &quot;free&quot; time to maintain the SNMP parts of the code.
Amos and Alex can correct me if I'm wrong.
There were plans to make the cache manager pages in a yaml format to allow programs to work with instead of parsing the current format.
I do not know were these plans stand and I believe that an extended SNMPD commands might be pretty useful since not everything in the cache manager pages is available via the SNMP.

It will require some development time and a bit of QA but the relevant things are:
* Prometheus (json)
* SNMP
* others (yaml)

It's pretty simple to parse the current cache manager to specific degree and specific developers and to convert it to json/yaml is also pretty simple.
I remember that I have some code somewhere that does some of the heavy lifting in such a project.

I will say something like this:
Let make a DIFF and see what happens, what do you think?

Eliezer

Doesn't it?

I mean, some data are already avilable via SNMP.

If there are gauges and counters in squid and they are available via SNMP, 
we can expect them to be correct, am I right?

is it that they are in squid but not available via SNMP?
