this is how squid works - it needs to cleanly close connections etc.

you can lower shutdown_lifetime option in config file 

&gt;<i> One of the main purposes for Squid on my system is to proxy Chromium, 
</I>&gt;<i> which likewise has the brilliant design of continuing to load page 
</I>&gt;<i> elements (on my extremely low bandwidth connection with a quota) when I've

</I>&gt;<i> to it, via killing the proxy.
</I>
try different browser probably. I don't know if chromium has option not to 
fetch images etc.

&gt;<i> So is there a signal that can be sent which is the exact equivalent of 
</I>&gt;<i> squid -k interrupt?  The only reason I was using that command in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> place is because 'kill' wasn't doing the job correctly.
</I>
either shut it down correctly so it can start again, or don't shut it down 
and then expect not being able to start.

&gt;<i> Why, oh why, does the config file have to be 100% valid, when the request 
</I>&gt;<i> is to simply STOP the damn thing?  That makes no logical sense.
</I>
this makes much sense and has already been explained.
starting with invalid configuration ignorec means possible unexpected 
behaviour.

according to what you wrote above, I am sure you don't want to squid fetch 
full content of interrupted transactions just because config directives were 
not read properly.


&gt;<i>  Deciding 
</I>&gt;<i> to crash on some obscure malformed config directive while simply giving 
</I>&gt;<i> the command to STOP is NOT the right way to handle the situation.  Forget 
</I>&gt;<i> about &quot;not enough resources to add that feature.&quot; That is how it should 
</I>&gt;<i> have been designed from day one!  So basically, &quot;not enough resources to 
</I>&gt;<i> fix what we designed wrong in the first place.&quot; To be fair, I guess you 
</I>&gt;<i> just initially assumed everyone would want the proxy to finish up what 
</I>&gt;<i> it's doing before quitting.  But that's not true in every case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is actual use of the pidfile to the end user, when kill -9 does not 
</I>&gt;<i> actually kill the damn thing,
</I>
kill -9 DOES kill the damn thing, and it doesn't allow the damn thing 
cleaning up the mess.

&gt;<i> but actually fucks things up worse by 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving zombie processes running in the background--and SIGTERM doesn't do 
</I>&gt;<i> the job either, even when asked twice?  Why the hell aren't all signals 
</I>&gt;<i> being forwarded to the child process(es), or otherwise architected so 
</I>&gt;<i> death of the controlling process brings down the whole thing?
</I>
this discussion makes no sense.
if you don't like how squid works, try e.g. wwwoffle.
