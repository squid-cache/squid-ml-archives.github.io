<PRE>Hey Ahmad,

 

You should use a tproxy port with a PROXY protocol support and acls.

With these you can try to push traffic to the network from a local process
that will write the right details to squid that will generate a fake source
ip.


And since you have asked I assume you are not familiar enough with this kind
of setup so it's crucial you will understand what are doing
before trying and testing it since at might not work as you expect.

 

All The Bests,

Eliezer

Subject: [squid-users] is there a way to tell squid to write external ip
even that external ip not attached into the machine ?

 

 

Hello Guys ,

We are testing squid with a project such as we need squid to write and
proceed with tcp_outgoing address address even its not attached to the
machine by ifconfig or ip add  ?

 

After some tests we found that squid wont write the external Ip to be pushed
out the network card interface if the ip address is not added to the machine
.

 

Is there anyway to bypass this checkout and let squid ignore checking the
external ips if attached or not attached ?

Not sure if from config or may be editing src files .

 

 

Many Thanks
