<PRE>Hello Eliezer
I thought it could be done by editing squid src file  like to skip inet address lookup .

Thanks

Hey Ahmad,

You should use a tproxy port with a PROXY protocol support and acls.
With these you can try to push traffic to the network from a local process that will write the right details to squid that will generate a fake source ip.

And since you have asked I assume you are not familiar enough with this kind of setup so it&#8217;s crucial you will understand what are doing
before trying and testing it since at might not work as you expect.

All The Bests,
Eliezer

Subject: [squid-users] is there a way to tell squid to write external ip even that external ip not attached into the machine ?


Hello Guys ,
We are testing squid with a project such as we need squid to write and proceed with tcp_outgoing address address even its not attached to the machine by ifconfig or ip add  ?

After some tests we found that squid wont write the external Ip to be pushed out the network card interface if the ip address is not added to the machine .

Is there anyway to bypass this checkout and let squid ignore checking the external ips if attached or not attached ?
Not sure if from config or may be editing src files .


Many Thanks
