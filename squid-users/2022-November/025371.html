</I>
Hum.  I have more questions than answers.  I'm not aware of W3C ever 
assigning ports.  I thought it was /always/ IANA.

&gt;<i> Indeed, thus we cannot register it with IEFT/IANA now. The IANA http-alt 
</I>&gt;<i> port would probably be best if we did go official.
</I>
ACK

&gt;<i> You see my point I hope. A gateway proxy that returns an error to 
</I>&gt;<i> *every* request is not very good.
</I>
Except it's not &quot;/ever/ /request/&quot;  It's &quot;/every/ /request/ /of/ /a/ 
/specific/ /type/&quot; where type is an HTTP version.

What does CloudFlare or any of the other big proxy services or even 
other proxy applications do if you send them an HTTP/1.0 or even 
HTTP/0.9 request without the associated Host: header?

&gt;<i> There is no &quot;configured proxy&quot; for this use-case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those are the two most/extremely common instances of the problematic 
</I>&gt;<i> use-cases. All implicit use of proxy (or gateway) have the same issue.
</I>
How common is the (network) transparent / intercepting / implicit use of 
Squid (or any proxy for that matter)?

All of the installs that I've worked on (both as a user and as an 
administrator) have been explicit / non-transparent.

&gt;<i> I think you are getting stuck with the subtle difference between &quot;use 
</I>&gt;<i> for case X&quot; and &quot;use by default&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ANY port number can be used for *some* use-case(s).
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i> &quot;by default&quot; has to work for *all* use-cases.
</I>
I disagree.

&gt;<i> Note that you are now having to add a non-default port &quot;8080&quot; and path 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/&quot; to the URL to make it valid/accepted by the Browser.
</I>
You were already specifying the non-default-http port via the 
&quot;http-<A HREF="alt://">alt://</A>&quot; scheme in your example.

&gt;<i> Clients speaking HTTP origin-form (the <A HREF="http://">http://</A> scheme) are not permitted 
</I>&gt;<i> to request tunnels or equivalent gateway services. They can only ask for 
</I>&gt;<i> resource representations.
</I>
I question the veracity of that.  Mostly around said client's use of an 
explicit proxy.

&gt;<i> Port is just a number, it can be anything *IF* it is made explicit.
</I>&gt;<i> The scheme determines what protocol syntax is being spoken and thus what 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions and/or requirements are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... and so the protocol for talking to a webcache service is http-<A HREF="alt://.">alt://.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Whose default port is not 80 nor 443 for all the same reasons why Squid 
</I>&gt;<i> default listening port is 3128.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we wanted to we could easily switch Squid default port to 
</I>&gt;<i> http-alt/8080 without causing technical issues. But it would be annoying 
</I>&gt;<i> to update all the existing documentation around the Internet, so not 
</I>&gt;<i> worth the effort changing now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto. Though the legacy install base has a long long long tail. 26 
</I>&gt;<i> years after HTTP/1.0 came out and HTTP/0.9 still has use-cases alive.
</I>
Where is HTTP/0.9 still being used?

&gt;<i> Decreasing, but still a potentially significant amount of traffic seen 
</I>&gt;<i> by Squid in general.
</I>
Can you, or anyone else, quantify what &quot;a potentially significant amount 
of traffic&quot; is?

Do these cases *really* /need/ to be covered by the /default/ 
configuration?  Or can they be addressed by a variation from the default 
configuration?

&gt;<i> Ah, if you have been treating it like an irrelevant elephant that is 
</I>&gt;<i> your confusion. The &quot;but not always&quot; is a critical detail in the puzzle 
</I>&gt;<i> - its side-effects are the answer to your initial question of *why* 
</I>&gt;<i> Squid defaults to X instead of 80/443.
</I>
I have no problems using non-default for the &quot;but not always&quot; 
configurations.
