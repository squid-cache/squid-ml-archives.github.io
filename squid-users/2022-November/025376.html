Sorry, that was unintentional.

</I>
ACK

&gt;<i> In all proxying cases there is special configuration somewhere. For 
</I>&gt;<i> forward-proxy it is in the client (or its OS so-called &quot;default&quot;), for 
</I>&gt;<i> reverse-proxy it is in the proxy, for interception-proxy it is in both 
</I>&gt;<i> the network and the proxy.
</I>
ACK

&gt;<i> The working ones deliver an HTTP/1.1 302 redirect to their companies 
</I>&gt;<i> homepage if the request came from outside the company LAN. If the 
</I>&gt;<i> request came from an administrators machine it may respond with stats 
</I>&gt;<i> data about the node being probed.
</I>
I suspect that Squid et al. could do similar.  ;-)

&gt;<i> Almost all the installs I have worked on had interception as part of 
</I>&gt;<i> their configuration.
</I>
Fair enough.

&gt;<i> It is officially recommended to include interception as a backup 
</I>&gt;<i> to explicit forward-proxy for networks needing full traffic control 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or monitoring.
</I>
I've taken things one step further.  I forego the interception and 
simply have the firewall / router hard block traffic not from the proxy 
server.  }:-)

But short of that, I see and acknowledge the value of interception.

&gt;<i> I take it from your statement you have not worked on networks like 
</I>&gt;<i> web-cafes, airports, schools, hospitals, public shopping malls who all 
</I>&gt;<i> use captive portal systems, or high-security institutions capturing 
</I>&gt;<i> traffic for personnel activity audits.
</I>
I have worked in schools, and other public places, some of which had a 
captive portal that intercepted to a web server to process registration 
or flat blocked non-proxied traffic.  The proxy server in those cases 
was explicit.

&gt;<i> There are also at least a half dozen nation states with national 
</I>&gt;<i> firewalls doing traffic monitoring and censorship. At least 3 of the 
</I>&gt;<i> ones I know of use Squid's for the HTTP portion.
</I>
I'm aware of a small number of such nation states.  I assume that there 
are many more.  I was not aware that Squid played in that arena.

&gt;<i> ACK. That is you. I am coming at this from the maintainer viewpoint 
</I>&gt;<i> where the entire community's needs have to be balanced.
</I>
I maintain that the /default/ does not have to work for /all/ use cases.

I agree that the /default/ should work for /most/ use cases.

The current default doesn't work on servers using NLD Active API Server. 
  Ergo the current default doesn't work on /all/ use cases.  }:-)

&gt;<i> And you were specifying the non-default-'http-alt' port via the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="http://">http://</A>&quot; scheme in yours.
</I>&gt;<i> Either way these are two different HTTP syntax with different &quot;default 
</I>&gt;<i> port&quot; values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An agent supporting the <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URL treats it as a request for some 
</I>&gt;<i> resource at the HTTP origin server indicated by the URL authority part 
</I>&gt;<i> or Host header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An agent supporting the http-<A HREF="alt://">alt://</A> URL treats it as a request to 
</I>&gt;<i> forward-proxy the request-target specified in the URL query segment, 
</I>&gt;<i> using the upstream proxy indicated by the URL authority part or Host 
</I>&gt;<i> header.
</I>
If I'm understanding correctly, this is a case of someone asking Bob to 
connect to Bob.  That's not a thing.  Just talk directly to Bob.

&gt;<i> The ones I am aware of are:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;* HTTP software testing and development
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;* IoT sensor polling
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;* printer network bootstrapping
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;* manufacturing controller management
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;* network stability monitoring systems
</I>
Why is anything developed in the last two decades green fielding with 
HTTP/0.9?!?!?!

&gt;<i> I doubt anyone can quantify it accurately. But worldwide use of HTTP/1.1 
</I>&gt;<i> is also dropping, and at a faster rate than 0.9/1.0 right now as the 
</I>&gt;<i> more efficient HTTP/2+ expand.
</I>
Sure.  There should be three categories of migrations:

HTTP/0.9 to something
HTTP/1.0 to something
HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2

I sincerely hope that the somethings are going to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.

&gt;<i> HTTP/1.1 specification requires semantic compatibility. So long as 1.1 
</I>&gt;<i> is still a thing the older versions are likely to remain as well. 
</I>&gt;<i> Undesirable as that may be.
</I>
ACK
