My comment was more directed at why is $LANGUAGE_DOESNT_MATTER used /in/ 
/the/ /location/ /field/?

I understand and agree with (re)using JavaScript as the chosen language. 
  That's not my concern.  (See above.)

&gt;<i> because standard servers and not proxies usually run on standard ports.
</I>
I trust that you don't intend it to be, but that feels like a non-answer 
to me.

That's sort of tantamount to saying &quot;I drive on the shoulder because 
there are cards on the road.&quot;

HTTP(S) connections /are/ the HTTP protocol and the standard port for 
HTTP protocol is port 80 for unencrypted connections and port 443 for 
encrypted connections.

I rarely see a web server and a proxy server (as in different service 
daemons) run /on/ /the/ /same/ /system/.  As such there is no conflict 
between ports on different systems / IPs.

The rare case where I do see a web server and a proxy server (still 
different service daemons) frequently are using different IPs.  The 
proxy is usually listening on a globally routed IP while the web server 
is listening on the loopback IP.

Then there is the entire different class where the same daemon functions 
as the web server and the proxy server.  Apache's HTTPD and Nginx 
immediately come to mind as fulfilling both functions.

So ... I feel like &quot;de-conflicting ports&quot; is as true as &quot;having to have 
different IPs for different TLS certificates&quot;.

&gt;<i> Also, FTP protocol (port 21) does not support proxying, and using FTP 
</I>&gt;<i> proxy usually involves hacks.
</I>
I completely disagree.

I've been using FTP through proxies for years.  Firefox (and 
Thunderbird) has an option /specifically/ for using FTP through proxies. 
  As depicted in the the picture of Firefox on the page that Rafael A. 
linked to.

All mainstream web browsers have had support for proxying FTP traffic 
for (at least) 15 of the last 25 years.  Up to the point that they 
started removing FTP protocol support from the browser.
