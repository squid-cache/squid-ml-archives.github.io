I knew that I had seen something about using an FTP proxy that wasn't 
HTTP related.

I encourage you to read ~/.ncftp/firewall for more details. 
Conveniently copied below.

I'd like to point out two things:

1)  The syntax and ports used only reference FTP.
2)  The 'NcFTP does NOT support HTTP proxies that do FTP, such as 
&quot;squid&quot; or Netscape Proxy Server.  Why?  Because you have to communicate 
with them using HTTP, and this is a FTP only program.'

So ... yes, I am quite certain that there are FTP /proxies/ that are NOT 
using HTTP.

--8&lt;--
# NcFTP firewall preferences
# ==========================
#
# If you need to use a proxy for FTP, you can configure it below.
# If you do not need one, leave the ``firewall-type'' variable set
# to 0.  Any line that does not begin with the ``#'' character is
# considered a configuration command line.
#
# NOTE:  NcFTP does NOT support HTTP proxies that do FTP, such as &quot;squid&quot;
#        or Netscape Proxy Server.  Why?  Because you have to 
communicate with
#        them using HTTP, and this is a FTP only program.
#
# Types of firewalls:
# ------------------
#
#    type 1:  Connect to firewall host, but send &quot;USER <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at real.host.name</A>&quot;
#
#    type 2:  Connect to firewall, login with &quot;USER fwuser&quot; and
#             &quot;PASS fwpassword&quot;, and then &quot;USER <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at real.host.name</A>&quot;
#
#    type 3:  Connect to and login to firewall, and then use
#             &quot;SITE real.host.name&quot;, followed by the regular USER and PASS.
#
#    type 4:  Connect to and login to firewall, and then use
#             &quot;OPEN real.host.name&quot;, followed by the regular USER and PASS.
#
#    type 5:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             &quot;USER <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at fwuser</A>@real.host.name&quot; and
#             &quot;PASS <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">pass at fwpass</A>&quot; to login.
#
#    type 6:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             &quot;USER <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">fwuser at real.host.name</A>&quot; and
#             &quot;PASS fwpass&quot; followed by a regular
#             &quot;USER user&quot; and
#             &quot;PASS pass&quot; to complete the login.
#
#    type 7:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             &quot;USER <A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at real.host.name</A> fwuser&quot; and
#             &quot;PASS pass&quot; followed by
#             &quot;ACCT fwpass&quot; to complete the login.
#
#    type 8:  Connect to firewall host, but send &quot;USER 
<A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at real.host.name</A>:port&quot;
#
#    type 9:  Connect to firewall host, but send &quot;USER 
<A HREF="https://lists.squid-cache.org/listinfo/squid-users">user at real.host.name</A> port&quot;
#
#    type 0:  Do NOT use a firewall (most users will choose this).
#
firewall-type=0
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-host'' variable should be the IP address or hostname of
# your firewall server machine.
#
firewall-host=firewall.home.example.net
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-user'' variable tells NcFTP what to use as the user ID
# when it logs in to the firewall before connecting to the outside world.
#
firewall-user=fwuser
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-password'' variable is the password associated with
# the firewall-user ID.  If you set this here, be sure to change the
# permissions on this file so that no one (except the superuser) can
# see your password.  You may also leave this commented out, and then
# NcFTP will prompt you each time for the password.
#
firewall-password=fwpass
#
#
#
# Your firewall may require you to connect to a non-standard port for
# outside FTP services, instead of the internet standard port number (21).
#
firewall-port=21
#
#
#
# You probably do not want to FTP to the firewall for hosts on your own
# domain.  You can set ``firewall-exception-list'' to a list of domains
# or hosts where the firewall should not be used.  For example, if your
# domain was ``probe.net'' you could set this to ``.probe.net''.
#
# If you leave this commented out, the default behavior is to attempt to
# lookup the current domain, and exclude hosts for it.  Otherwise, set it
# to a list of comma-delimited domains or hostnames.  The special token
# ``localdomain'' is used for unqualified hostnames, so if you want hosts
# without explicit domain names to avoid the firewall, be sure to include
# that in your list.
#
firewall-exception-list=.home.example.net,localhost,localdomain
#
#
#
# You may also specify passive mode here.  Normally this is set in the
# regular $HOME/.ncftp/prefs file.  This must be set to one of
# &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, or &quot;optional&quot;, which mean always use PASV,
# always use PORT, and try PASV then PORT, respectively.
#
#passive=on
#
#
#
# NOTE:  This file was created for you on Sat Jan 21 23:09:26 2017
#        by NcFTP 3.2.5.  Removing this file will cause the next run of 
NcFTP
#        to generate a new one, possibly with more configurable options.
#
# ALSO:  A /etc/ncftp.firewall file, if present, is processed before 
this file,
#        and a /etc/ncftp.firewall.fixed file, if present, is processed 
after.
