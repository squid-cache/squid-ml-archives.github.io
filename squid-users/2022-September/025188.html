Squid v3 is not officially supported. My answers below may apply to 
Squid v3, but they are based on Squid v5+.


&gt;<i> In order to address some issues with Java clients, we tried to lower

</I>&gt;<i> of simultaneous connections on our SSquid servers (about 100rq/s) 
</I>&gt;<i> After reducing the worker value to 1, and restarting the proxies, we

</I>&gt;<i> workers.
</I>
&gt;<i> - How the number of workers and these 403 errors can be correlated ?
</I>
I do not know the exact correlation vector in your environment, but 
fewer workers means, among other things, smaller _aggregate_ 
authentication cache size and higher load on individual authentication 
helpers. To pinpoint the correlation, we would need to know _why_ Squid 
is generating 403 (Forbidden) errors.


&gt;<i> - Is there any &quot;recommandations&quot; about the number of workers to use,
</I>&gt;<i> for a given number of request/s ?
</I>
Workers are primarily a performance optimization. For related tuning 
suggestions, please see 
<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#How_to_configure_SMP_Squid_for_top_performance.3F">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#How_to_configure_SMP_Squid_for_top_performance.3F</A>


&gt;<i> The inital problem is from some java clients, which are using two TCP
</I>&gt;<i> sessions, one for the authentication, and another one for the HTTP(s)
</I>&gt;<i> requests. The fact is that the &quot;second&quot; session is not always opened
</I>&gt;<i> on the same worker, so ot considers that the authentication step has
</I>&gt;<i> not already been done.
</I>
&gt;<i> Is there a way to address this issue ?
</I>
If (a request on) the second connection has enough information to link 
it to the first/authenticated request/connection, then it may be 
possible to configure Squid and write authentication helpers in such a 
way that the &quot;other&quot; worker knows that the client of the second 
connection has already authenticated. The details would depend on the 
authentication scheme and that &quot;linking&quot; mechanism.


HTH,

Alex.
