<PRE>Hello Alex,

Thanks for your answer.

&gt;&gt;<i> We are using two squid proxies (Squid 3.3)
</I>
&gt;<i>Squid v3 is not officially supported. My answers below may apply to 
</I>&gt;<i>Squid v3, but they are based on Squid v5+.
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i> In order to address some issues with Java clients, we tried to lower
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the worker directive from 8 to 1, because of the relative low number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of simultaneous connections on our SSquid servers (about 100rq/s) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After reducing the worker value to 1, and restarting the proxies, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> observed a great number of 403 errors, so we decided to rollback to 8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workers.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> - How the number of workers and these 403 errors can be correlated ?
</I>
&gt;<i>I do not know the exact correlation vector in your environment, but 
</I>&gt;<i>fewer workers means, among other things, smaller _aggregate_ 
</I>&gt;<i>authentication cache size and higher load on individual authentication 
</I>&gt;<i>helpers. To pinpoint the correlation, we would need to know _why_ Squid 
</I>&gt;<i>is generating 403 (Forbidden) errors.
</I>
Is there a specific way to find the reason ? Do I need to activate a certain logging level to see these traces ?
I will check in the actual logs and I'll come back if I don't find anything


&gt;&gt;<i> - Is there any &quot;recommandations&quot; about the number of workers to use,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a given number of request/s ?
</I>
&gt;<i>Workers are primarily a performance optimization. For related tuning 
</I>&gt;<i>suggestions, please see 
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#How_to_configure_SMP_Squid_for_top_performance.3F">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SmpScale#How_to_configure_SMP_Squid_for_top_performance.3F</A>
</I>
Yes, I saw and read this thread on the Wiki.
We were already using some of these recommandations.
I think we are quite far from a &quot;top performance&quot; but we didn't observed any performance issue when we used 8 workers.
I understand that an individual worker should be able to handle our actual load, but we have to find what is provoking the 403 errors first.

&gt;&gt;<i> The inital problem is from some java clients, which are using two TCP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sessions, one for the authentication, and another one for the HTTP(s)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requests. The fact is that the &quot;second&quot; session is not always opened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the same worker, so ot considers that the authentication step has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not already been done.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to address this issue ?
</I>
&gt;<i>If (a request on) the second connection has enough information to link 
</I>&gt;<i>it to the first/authenticated request/connection, then it may be 
</I>&gt;<i>possible to configure Squid and write authentication helpers in such a 
</I>&gt;<i>way that the &quot;other&quot; worker knows that the client of the second 
</I>&gt;<i>connection has already authenticated. The details would depend on the 
</I>&gt;<i>authentication scheme and that &quot;linking&quot; mechanism.
</I>
Do you have any example of an authentication helper I can start with ? or an example on how to &quot;link&quot; events between workers ?
I was thinking that workers were quite &quot;individuals&quot; and did not exchange anything (or verry little) with each other.
Any start point would be welcome.

Regards,
Xavier

If (a request on) the second connection has enough information to link 
it to the first/authenticated request/connection, then it may be 
possible to configure Squid and write authentication helpers in such a 
way that the &quot;other&quot; worker knows that the client of the second
