&gt;<i> &quot;Are any advanced algorithms, predictive analytics, dynamic components,

Yes, for some definition of those techniques.

For example, Squid supports such &quot;dynamic components&quot; as eCAP adaptation 
modules (that may use AI and similar techniques), and some Squid 
developers use &quot;auto-complete or suggested text functionalities&quot; and 
automated &quot;translation&quot; mentioned below as examples of (presumably) the 
&quot;techniques&quot; in the above question.

Nothing related to the above question should affect Squid adoption at 
Fannie Mae IMHO: FWIW, Squid code is created and/or curated by humans, 
just like it has been for decades, but we may use any new techniques at 
our disposal, so the past should not really matter.


&gt;<i> Examples of non-traditional modeling 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities include but are not limited to: auto-complete or suggested 
</I>&gt;<i> text functionalities; optical character recognition (OCR) or other image 
</I>&gt;<i> recognition and processing; transcription, translation, speech-to-text 
</I>&gt;<i> or text-to-speech; search engines; virtual assistants; and other 
</I>&gt;<i> assistive technologies.&quot;
</I>
Please note that the above examples do not quite match the question: The 
question does not use the words &quot;non-traditional modeling capabilities&quot;.

If you explain the actual goal of these questions, you may receive 
better guidance. Right now, it feels like virtually any complex software 
is likely to qualify for a &quot;yes&quot; answer because the question is so vague 
and so broad. For example, auto-complete has been in use for many years, 
long before large language models and AI bots using them became popular.


Cheers,

Alex.
