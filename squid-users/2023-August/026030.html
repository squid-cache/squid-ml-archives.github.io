FWIW, you should be upgrading to v6 instead. Squid v5 maintainer does 
not expect making regular bug-fixing v5 releases:

</I>
Mishandling/misreporting ERR_DNS_FAIL is a known problem. Or two. IIRC, 
at least two different scenarios suffer from that problem, one ends up 
with ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD and one with ERR_READ_ERROR.

FWIW, the Squid Project is improving CI tests to detect such unexpected 
changes in the future.

Thank you for sharing those details. When developers start working on a 
fix, they may find them very useful (if they can find them at that 
time). You may also want to post a bug report on Squid Bugzilla.


&gt;<i> Does anyone know if this is an intentional change or a bug?
</I>
The change was not intentional. In most cases, it is a bug: A catch-all 
ERR_CANNOT_FORWARD should not be used when a more specific ERR_X applies.


## Current 503 vs old 500 status code

Please note that not all ERR_DNS_FAIL should result in HTTP 503 (Service 
Unavailable) responses AFAICT.

For example, RFC 9209 section 2.3.2 recommends that DNS NXDOMAIN 
responses result in HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway) responses:
<A HREF="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9209.html#section-2.3.2">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9209.html#section-2.3.2</A>

However, the above recommendation does not quite match RFC 9110 
description of HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway) status code because NXDOMAIN is 
not an &quot;invalid response&quot; (it is a valid error response):
<A HREF="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.6.3">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.6.3</A>

The presence of multiple errors during forwarding attempts complicates 
the situation further.

Given all these uncertainties, if your infrastructure relies on a very 
specific HTTP status response code, it may be a good idea to redesign.


HTH,

Alex.
