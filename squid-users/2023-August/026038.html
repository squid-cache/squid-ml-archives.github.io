Squid is limited to selecting certain details of the TCP packets.
Device routing details are up to the operating system.

You can have Squid can set dst-IP or TOS/QoS marking on packets. The OS 
routing services should be able to use those to do its selection.



My use-case here is that I have multiple
&gt;<i> OpenVPN tunnels open and use Squid to funnel traffic through them
</I>&gt;<i> (including DNS queries which works great!). These OpenVPN tunnels all
</I>&gt;<i> have their own network device, but the IP address might or might not
</I>&gt;<i> change at some point, and when that happens Squid won't be able to
</I>&gt;<i> forward traffic anymore. Of course I can work around that (OpenVPN
</I>&gt;<i> `--ipchange` to fire a script when the IP changes), but I just wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to check whether I've missed something here.
</I>
In this case, leaving the outgoing IP to the OS is best.
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/tcp_outgoing_mark/">http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/tcp_outgoing_mark/</A>&gt; is available 
to mark (aka classify in QoS terms) Squid traffic for the OS routing.
