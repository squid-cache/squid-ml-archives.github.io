Squid 6.1 was released a few days ago and 4.x have reached their 
official EOS. You may want to try a newer version now.
  There have been numerous changes to CONNECT tunnel handling since 4.15 
which may help with your issue. Better debugging and logging of tunnel 
activities at very least may be useful to you.

</I>
Status 407 means the TCP connection which is being used has not yet been 
authenticated, OR the credentials given for it are not permitted to 
perform the action requested.

You will need to check:
  * whether those status 200 were using the same TCP connection (likely 
not), and
  * whether credentials were provided on the TCP connection (in the 
current HTTP request headers, or any prior HTTP request on that 
connection), and
  * what type of authentication is happening. The MS schemes have some 
peculiar and annoying impacts on HTTP.
