<PRE>Hello,

I have a strange problem (definitely some kind of my own ignorance) :

If I try to access anything on the site <A HREF="https://www.samba.org">https://www.samba.org</A> WITHOUT 
proxy, my browser negotiate happily for http/2 protocol and receives all 
the data. For&#160;<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A> WITHOUT proxy it starts with http/1.1 
which is auto-redirected from http to https and continues with http/2. 
So far so good.

But WITH proxy, it happens that squid is using http/1.0. The remote site 
is blocking this protocol, requiring at least http/1.1 (confirmed by the 
samba.org website maintainer), so the site remains inaccessible. But 
this is the only site where I have been able to encounter this problem. 
If I connect WITH proxy to other sites, squid is using http/1.1 as expected.

So, I'm lost here, unable to find the reason, why http/1.1 couldn't be 
used by squid in some rare cases. What am I missing here? I am not aware 
of any configuration directives which could cause this.

browsers: chrome, firefox (both updated)
squid: freebsd package (now version 6.5, but the I had the same problem 
with 5.9 before)

Thanks in advance for some hints here.
