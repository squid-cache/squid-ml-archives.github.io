<PRE>Hey List,

I have updated the squid-latest repo at:
<A HREF="https://github.com/elico/squid-latest">https://github.com/elico/squid-latest</A>

It's now parses the www.squid-cache.org sources page instead of using some ftp mirrors to get the latest version of squid.
This update is since the squid FTP mirrors I have used are no longer up-to-date since 5.9.

If you need to programmatically &quot;know&quot; the latest current version of squid-cache you can use the next json file:
<A HREF="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elico/squid-latest/main/latest.json">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elico/squid-latest/main/latest.json</A>

The NgTech Squid-Cache repository base url is at:
<A HREF="https://www.ngtech.co.il/repo/">https://www.ngtech.co.il/repo/</A>

and not like mentioned in the wiki docs with the domain &quot;ngtech.co.il&quot;.
(I will need to fix it later in the git and also maybe in couple other places)

And for all the SSL-BUMP users, there was a nice talk at Defcon 31:
DEF CON 31 - certmitm Automatic Exploitation of TLS Certificate Validation Vulns - Aapo Oksman

<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_l2q_Gyqfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_l2q_Gyqfo</A>

which I wanted to respond with couple words.

There is some wrong assumption that all data connections should be encrypted and there is a movement that tries to push the industry
to a place which requires vendors a very huge over head in their software maintenance and distribution chains.
There is plenty of data which should not be encrypted and is wrongfully encrypted both on the wires and also on different storage mechanisms.
I must state that I am not a security specialist but the world really hasn't changed for the last 5-6 k years.
There are many different ways to rob and do bad things to others and this is a fundamental and general flaw in education and morality.

if you have enough knowledge, power and couple other features and resources you would be able to forcefully access places you are not allowed into.

I believe that education will not improve most animals and predators and this is compared to me believing that a second chance should be 
granted however not to everyone.

My basic lesson from my teachers and parents is that you must act in specific directions in life if you want to get somewhere.
As much as it's nice to some degree to watch some of the Defcon &quot;shows&quot; I believe we first must understand that there are humans 
behind some mistakes and we should respect them before talking wrongfully about them.

To some degree obscurity is not a replacement for security however when you learn a bit from humanity past about theft
and other forms of crime you should be able to learn to respect the weaknesses of other humans.

To the memory of my late brother Yonatan, I have worked on a public digital edition of a book named:
&quot;Vaccination Register For the Purity of The Hebrew Language&quot;
Or in Hebrew:
&#1508;&#1504;&#1511;&#1505; &#1495;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514; &#1492;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;

It's a Hebrew written book and I doubt that any translation would be good enough to pass the content of the book.
I even doubt that reading the book in Hebrew would be enough to pass most of the content.

This is a link to the book digital edition which also has an audio recording of each part in it:
<A HREF="https://www.ngtech.co.il/%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%A1-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/">https://www.ngtech.co.il/%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%A1-%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/</A>

I know that some would ask: What is the relationship to the Squid-Cache project and this book?

I would like to say that the Squid-Cache Users list which I am a member for many years is one of the unique mailing lists around the world. 
Many security companies and IT experts are actively blocking the Squid-Cache domains and files since it's considered a &quot;bad software&quot;.

However, over the years I have learned so many things from the Squid-Cache project and all of it's resources, users and developers and I would like
to add a specific unique addition to this mailing list at this time.

In these time of the year in the Hebrew religious we are standing between two days:
Rosh Hashana, the day that the year starts and the yearly court day of god.
And 
Yom Kipur, the day which God forgive us on anything we might have done and is not between us and other humans.

In these days every year I am asking myself a very tough question:
Was I OK this year? Maybe I did something wrong to others?

And this is where I would like to say thanks for the Squid-Cache Users list and to also ask for forgiveness.
Not because I know I did something wrong but the opposite, I don't know whether I did something to others so I must first ask for one.

The: Event, Meaning, Emotion, Reaction model in psychology which is used in CBT(Cognitive behavioral therapy) gives some insights when looking
into some events in our life and I would like to just say that a simple &quot;Yours&quot; in the of an Email can change the whole meaning of the written words.

My late father tough me, and I must quote him: &quot;If you see someone that you love and he has something in his beard, tell him about it.&quot;
(Sometimes with the addition that a father of a friend told me to say so clears out the doubts about the sentence)

So, Thanks for everyone in the Squid-Cache project and with hope for a very blessed and happy new year.

Yours,
Eliezer Croitoru
