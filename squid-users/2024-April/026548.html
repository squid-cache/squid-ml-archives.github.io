</I>Just to add two more pieces of related information to this thread:

Some Squid admins report that their v6-based code does not suffer from 
this issue while their v5-based code does. I have not verified those 
reports, but there may be more to the story here. What Squid version are 
_you_ using?

One way to track progress with this annoying and complex issue is to 
follow the following pull request. The current code cannot be officially 
merged as is, and I would not recommend using it in production (because 
of low-level bugs that will probably crash Squid in some cases), but 
testing it in the lab and providing feedback to authors may be useful:

HTH,
