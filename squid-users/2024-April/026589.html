<PRE>Hello,

after a few attempts and tests with Squid (version 5.7) under Windows
Server 2022 - &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot; with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, I
decided to install newer versions of Squid (e.g. v6.9) on the system in
question. In doing so, I encountered problems that I did not expect and
had not yet found a solution to. First of all, I am not a Linux expert
and therefore hope to get some valuable tips and advice from the community.
So, what is it all about?
I want to compile, install and run the latest version of Squid (v6.9)
under WSL2 (I'm running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
What exactly have I done ?
- downloaded the latest squid_6.9.tar.gz and put it in the /opt directory
- unpacked tar with tar xzf
- ./configure as specified on the squid-cache-faq page for Ubuntu:
--prefix=/usr \
--localstatedir=/var \
--libexecdir=${prefix}/lib/squid \
--datadir=${prefix}/share/squid \
--sysconfdir=/etc/squid \
--with-default-user=administrator \ ### a deviation here
--with-logdir=/var/log/squid \
--with-pidfile=/var/run/squid.pid
- Missing dependencies like
gcc
c++
g++
clang
perl
libssl-dev
as packages via apt-get install and installed
- executed ./configure again and checked for any missing dependencies
- after Ok, then executed the following steps
- make executed (completed successfully)
- make check (completed successfully)
- make install (completed successfully)
After the installation, however, I notice that squid cannot be started.
The error message says that squid cannot find the squid.service.
Obviously not everything was installed correctly or completely during
the installation. When I search for the file in question in the folder,
this file is nowhere to be found (except of course in the compressed
squid.tar file). Strange.
When setting up WSL2 for the first time, you are asked for the main
user: the main user is &quot;administrator&quot; --&gt; hence a change when calling
the ./configure command (default-user). I think this is correct.
However, I also carried out the installation as &quot;root&quot;. The behavior is
the same.
I have already carried out 4 or 5 compilations and installations with
slight differences. Unfortunately, I am not successful. Squid cannot be
started.
I hope there is someone in the community who has already had experience
with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and can give me a little help to
get the whole thing working after all. Is it perhaps an access problem
that occurred during installation? (I have read that Ubuntu is partly
different from the &quot;original&quot; Linux). Or is my configuration
(./configure) insufficient or incomplete.
Since the Squid project is very interesting and I would like to follow
it and gain experience, I would be happy to receive your tips.

Have a nice Sunday and greetings from Germany
Yvon
