&gt;<i> Has anyone else taken up the fun challenge of doing windows update caching. It is amazing when it works right. It is a complex configuration, but it is worth it to see a warm download come down that originally took 30 mins instantly to a second client.

There have been several people over the years.
The collected information is being gathered at 
&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Caching/WindowsUpdates">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Caching/WindowsUpdates</A>&gt;

If you would like to check and update the information for the current 
Windows 11 and Squid 6, etc. that would be useful.

Wiki updates are now made using github PRs against the repository at 
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid-cache.github.io">https://github.com/squid-cache/squid-cache.github.io</A>&gt;.




&gt;<i> Amazing stuff Squid team.
</I>&gt;<i> I wish I could get some of the Roblox Xbox stuff to cache but it&#8217;s a night to get running with squid in the first place, I had to splice a bunch of stuff and also wpad the Xbox system.
</I>
FWIW, what I have seen from routing perspective is that Roblox likes to 
use custom ports and P2P connections for a lot of things. So no high 
expectations there, but anything cacheable is great news.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can say my experience was a massive increase in the warm download it was delivered in under a couple mins versus 30 or so to download it cold. The warm download was almost instant on the second device. Very green energy efficient.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does squid 5.8 or 6 work better on warm delivery?
</I>
There is no significant differences AFAIK. They both come down to what 
you have configured. That said, the ongoing improvements may make v6 
some amount of &quot;better&quot; - even if only trivial.



&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to make 100 percent sure a docker container can&#8217;t get inside the cache?
</I>
For Windows I would expect the only &quot;100% sure&quot; way is to completely 
forbid access to the disk where the cache is stored.


The rest of your questions are about container management and Windows 
configuration. Which are kind of off-topic.
