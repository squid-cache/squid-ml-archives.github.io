<PRE>Hi,

It seems that on macOS with homebrew, that the squid files are not
installed in a proper subdirectory like they are on linux.

I installed squid on macOS with `brew install squid`
I then noticed that the conf file is found at `/opt/homebrew/etc/squid.conf`
And then after some digging and searching, found that the access.log and
cache.log are at `/opt/homebrew/var/logs/{access,cache}.log`.

But the part that doesn't seem good here is that these files are not being
put into folders.
In `/opt/homebrew/etc/` for example, it would be better if the three files
that squid created: squid.conf, squid.conf.default,
and squid.conf.documented were put into a subdir like
`/opt/homebrew/etc/squid/squid.conf` etc.
That would be better organization.

It's worse for the log files because they are just in the root logs folder
with generic names &quot;access&quot; and &quot;cache&quot;, and so some other program could
use the same file names and they might overwrite each other!

In linux installs, there is a subdir.

Can this be fixed?

Thanks,
