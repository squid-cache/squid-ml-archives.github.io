<PRE> This week, when connecting users through a proxy server, some Google
services became inaccessible, such as Calendar, Translator, user profile.

When clicking on the services section in the browser on the Google portal,
the page does not open and then a connection error is displayed. When
directly going to the calendar section, the connection also hangs for a
long time without loading the page. At the same time, the Google home page,
mail, search work.

Transparent proxying is not used.
Viewing the proxy server logs did not add any understanding, all requests
are processed correctly and no errors or prohibitions are observed. There
are no other problems with the unavailability of any sites.

When connecting directly (bypassing the proxy server), all Google services
work completely correctly.
The platform on which the problem was suddenly discovered:
FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE-p9
Squid 6.6

A new separate server was deployed for objectivity and finding the cause,
but the problem was also reproduced there, its platform.
FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE-p2
Squid 6.10

I tried using the default configuration file (recommended minimum
configuration) to eliminate the problem in my working squid.conf, but the
problem remained

I repeat, the problem reproduced suddenly, no changes were made to the
proxy server configuration on our side, no problems with Google have arisen
for many years. What should I pay attention to in the Squid configuration?
Any idea
