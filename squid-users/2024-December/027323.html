Do you use any ssl_bump directives? You have mentioned a test with 
&quot;default configuration file&quot; below. That configuration file does not 
have any ssl_bump directives. When testing with that default 
configuration file, did you add any ssl_bump directives?

If you are not using SslBump, then suggestions regarding &quot;splicing&quot; do 
not apply to your environment -- your Squid is already effectively 
splicing all TLS connections. In this case, please clarify whether 
&quot;Operation timed out&quot; failures that you have mentioned in your second 
post are also reflected in access.log records. You have said that &quot;all 
requests are processed correctly and no errors or prohibitions are 
observed&quot;, and I am trying to correlate that statement with those 
timeout errors...

Do you know whether these timeout errors were present when everything 
was working correctly?

Do you always see at least one such timeout error for every case when 
&quot;the page does not open and then a connection error is displayed&quot;? In 
other words, is there a strong correlation between client-side problems 
and these timeout errors in cache.log?


Thank you,

Alex.
