<PRE>Hey Everybody,

I am just releasing the latest 6.7 RPMs and binaries while running couple tests and I was wondering if this was done.
As I am looking at proxy, in most cases it's being used as a policy enforcer rather than an education tool.
I believe in education as one of the top priorities compared to enforcing policies.
The nature of policies depends on the environment and the risks but eventually understanding the meaning of the policy
gives a lot to the cooperation of the user or an employee.

I have yet to see a solution like the next:
Each user has a profile/user which when receiving a policy block will be prompted with an option to allow temporarily 
the specific site or domain.
Also, I have not seen an implementation which allows the user to disable or lower the policy strictness for a short period of time.

I am looking for such implementations if those exist already to run education sessions with teenagers.

Thanks,
Eliezer
