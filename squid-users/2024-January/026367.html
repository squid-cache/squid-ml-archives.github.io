<PRE>We currently are unable to upgrade to squid6 due to a serious problem we found with collapsed_forwarding (<A HREF="https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5332">https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5332</A>), and our applications need collapsed_forwarding for reasonable performance.

So we want to build a version of squid5 with as many vulnerabilities patched as we can.  All the posted 2023 vulnerabilities we care about include squid5 patches except one: <A HREF="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-rj5h-46j6-q2g5.">https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-rj5h-46j6-q2g5.</A>  That is listed only as being patched in version 6.0.1, which is not an option.  

I'm pretty sure based on the &quot;Patches Released&quot; date listed at the bottom of the advisory that this was fixed in <A HREF="https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/1127.">https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/1127.</A>  A further corroboration is that Joshua's vulnerability list at
    <A HREF="https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/">https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/</A>
lists that GHSA as a fix for &quot;Use-After-Free in TRACE requests&quot; and the description at
    <A HREF="https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/trace-uaf.html">https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/trace-uaf.html</A>
points to a bit of code that was deleted in the above PR.

So, my question is: since Joshua said the vulnerability was in the TRACE request, is another workaround to disable TRACE requests rather than disabling collapsed_forwarding?  That's something we can do, where disabling collapsed_forwarding is not something we can do.
