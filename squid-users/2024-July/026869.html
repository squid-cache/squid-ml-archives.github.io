<PRE>We did an upgrade from 5.7 to 5.9 and after the upgrade the whitelists we had were gone. We had to recreate them and set them up under the access control section.
Anyone seen this? I have another one in queue for upgrade, and will get more info once we run the upgrade, but wanted to ask if this is a known issue.
Also our delay pool had to be recreated as well.
