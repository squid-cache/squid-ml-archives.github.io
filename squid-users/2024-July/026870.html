What do you use to upgrade/install Squid? Do you build Squid from 
sources and then run &quot;make install&quot;? Or do you use some packaging 
software provided by a third party?

Do you put your access rules (a.k.a. whitelists) into squid.conf? Was 
you squid.conf overwritten? With some default configuration??


FWIW, native Squid &quot;make install&quot; does not install or update squid.conf 
file AFAICT. It installs squid.cond.documented and squid.conf.default.


HTH,

Alex.
