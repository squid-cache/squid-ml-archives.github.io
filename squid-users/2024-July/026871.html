<PRE>Our whitelists are separate files. The files were still in the /etc/squid directory, but the configs were gone.
We actually go old school and use webmin to manage the squid server and it showed an upgrade.
I am thinking the squid.conf got overwritten, which caused our issue.

What do you use to upgrade/install Squid? Do you build Squid from sources and then run &quot;make install&quot;? Or do you use some packaging software provided by a third party?

Do you put your access rules (a.k.a. whitelists) into squid.conf? Was you squid.conf overwritten? With some default configuration??


FWIW, native Squid &quot;make install&quot; does not install or update squid.conf file AFAICT. It installs squid.cond.documented and squid.conf.default.


HTH,

Alex.
