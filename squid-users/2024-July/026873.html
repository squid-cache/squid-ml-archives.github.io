It sounds like this is a webmin issue rather than a Squid issue. I do 
not know much about webmin. I hope somebody else here can help you with 
webmin integration, but please consider contacting webmin folks for support.


&gt;<i> I am thinking the squid.conf got overwritten, which caused our issue.
</I>
If it was overwritten, it was not overwritten by Squid (i.e. by anything 
shipped by the Squid Project).


HTH,

Alex.
