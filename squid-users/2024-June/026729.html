<PRE>Hey Jonathan,

First of all, thanks for the response.
I think that all squid-users knows that AI is there since very long ago.
However, since it's a tool of the current times I want to be familiar with the tool capabilities.
The AI tools which are published these days gives a specific response to a specific requirement and need with the growth of IT in the world.

Squid-Cache users list is a place which you can ask a question and a human with emotions, sensitivity and knowledge try to help.
This is one of the only places which I don't even remember someone responding with &quot;google it&quot; or something similar.
The question I am asking myself is: 
I and others will not be here some time in the future and we try to document and leave after us things for the future.
I can try to say that we are working here with UDP and not TCP ie we are sending what we have into the world with the hope
it will reach others and will help them and make them happy and lively.

I believe that it's possible to learn things about Squid-Cache with the existing tools in an interactive way.
There are many documentations on Squid-Cache but some are old and others are just plain wrong.

I have some spare time here and there and I want to write a set of challenges for proxy admins.
I am thinking about it something like:
What might certify a Squid-Cache admin to be capable to be a successful admin?

The first things that most certifications do is to make sure there is &quot;knowledge&quot; or that the admin can implement specific use cases.
I believe that above the knowledge and technical capabilities there is a whole other level which might be lost when some will not be here.
I would be happy if the AI tools will be able to grasp from the mailing list threads something more then just the technical aspect of things.

Do you think a SoundBlaster 16 ISA card on a 386 or Pentium can transfer that?

Squid indeed is a very complex software!!

How can we attract some new Squid users into the list or to try and complete couple challenges?
Also, there are new versions of Linux distros around and these are a great playground for testing.

I will try to see if the AI can summarize the functionality of Squid-Cache (else then the cache itself).
I wrote couple caching tools in the past 10 years and I think that the new AI tools might be able to find
couple things which I missed and maybe offer better solutions for couple things.

Maybe some external_acl helpers or maybe to convert existing tools to rust or golang.
Maybe even these tools will be able to offer some ideas on how to fix specific bugs.
Even if they will not write the whole code for it the fact that what someone else wrote somewhere on the internet is
reaching to the prompt user we might be able to understand how a single document can affect a lot on the end result.

Let's try to follow on this thread later on.

Thanks,
Eliezer

I hate to tell you this AI that you know has been around for many years.
Anyone remember Sandblaster 16 ISA card software Dr. Spatzo?
All AI is, just adapted improved 1980s ideas. It&#8217;s not new, its been here for years, still just if else code with more data analytics. 

Anyway I use Proxy for checking URL requests and blocking them if needed, inspecting HTTPS with antivirus software, caching content and having the ability to scan it before it hits users and block it.
Web acceleration.
I primarily use it for inspection and security.
Squid could simply block out all requests to AI if you wanted, I have it set to block some.
CCPA in California provides legal avenues for user privacy, not many web analytics companies follow the requests to not track so they can be simply put blocked out. 

Squid is very complex software.
