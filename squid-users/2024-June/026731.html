<PRE>Hey Akash,
(Is this your first name?)
 
There are ways to test the config step by step with docker containers but it depends on the config size and complexity.
Even if you cannot share the squid.conf you can still summarize it to a degree.
There are 2 types of proxy services which can be implemented by Squid:
*	Forward
*	Reverse
 
With these there are tons of bricks which can be pilled up to achieve functionality.
@Alex and @Amos, can you try to help me compile a menu list of functionalities that Squid-Cache can be used for?
Ie as a forward proxy..
 
I believe that the project can offer a set of generic recipes for use cases that every support case will be able to look at to ask about.
Currently there are many questions which were answered but not all of them a documented enough to answer the use cases.
I can take this 4.15 to 6.9 as an example project and to document it for simplicity of others.
 
I will try to take a peek at the release notes from 4.15 till 6.9 to understand if there are specific things to be aware of for my specific use case.
 
The first thing I think should be mentioned is the list of deprecated helpers.
 
Thanks,
Eliezer

Hi Team,
 
We are running on squid ver 4.15 and want to update to n-1 of the latest ver(I believe 6.9 is the latest ver).
 
I want to understand if we can go straight from 4.15 to 6.x (n-1 of latest version) without any intermediary steps or do we have to  update to intermediary first and then move to the n-1 version of 6.9?
 
Kindly send us the detailed guidance!
