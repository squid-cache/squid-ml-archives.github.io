Please do test any suggested changes. There are too many variables here 
for me to guarantee that a particular set of http_access and ssl_bump 
rules works as expected.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> squid doesn't seem to validate that the IP address we're connecting 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to is valid for the specified name in the SNI header?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That observation matches my reading of Squid Host header forgery 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detection code which says &quot;we do not yet handle CONNECT tunnels well, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so ignore for them&quot;. To validate that theory, use &quot;debug_options 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ALL,3&quot; and look for &quot;SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages in cache.log.
</I>
&gt;<i> I've enabled this debug option, but I never see the security alert in 
</I>&gt;<i> the logs. Maybe it was introduced in more recent versions? I'm currently 
</I>&gt;<i> using Squid 5.5 that comes with Rocky Linux 9.4.
</I>
The code logging &quot;SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected&quot; messages 
is present in v5.5, but perhaps it is not triggered in that version (or 
even in modern/supported Squids) when I expect it to be triggered. 
Unfortunately, there are too many variables for me to predict what 
exactly went wrong in your particular test case without doing a lot more 
work (and I cannot volunteer to do that work right now).


&gt;<i> Looking at the logs, I'm also having problems determining where each 
</I>&gt;<i> ssl-bump step is started.
</I>
Yes, it is a known problem (even for developers). There are also bugs 
related to step boundaries.


&gt;&gt;<i> Peeking at the server certificates happens at step3. In many modern 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use cases, server certificates are encrypted, so a _peeking_ Squid 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot see them. To validate, Squid has to bump the tunnel (supported 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> today but problematic for other reasons) or be enhanced to use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out-of-band validation tricks (that come with their own set of problems).
</I>
&gt;<i> I guess that explains why if I add &quot;%ssl::&lt;cert_subject&quot; to my logformat 
</I>&gt;<i> for the access log, the field is always &quot;-&quot;?
</I>
It may explain that, but other problems may lead to the same &quot;no 
certificate&quot; result as well, of course. You can kind of check by using 
stare/bump instead of peek/splice -- if you see certificate details 
logged in that bumping test, then it is more likely that Squid just does 
not get a plain text certificate in peeking configurations.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to configure squid to validate that the server 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certificate is valid for the host specified in the SNI header?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIRC, that validation happens automatically in modern Squid versions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when Squid receives an (unencrypted) server certificate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you happen to known which version of Squid introduced that check?
</I>
IIRC, Squid v5.5 has that code.


HTH,

Alex.
