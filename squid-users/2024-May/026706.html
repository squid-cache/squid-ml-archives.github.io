</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing a lot more work (and I cannot volunteer to do that work right now).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at <A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery,">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> it always seems to mention the Host header. It has no mention of 
</I>&gt;<i> performing the same checks for the SNI value. Since we're peeking at the 
</I>&gt;<i> request, we can't see the actual Host header being sent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
FYI, The SSL-Bump feature uses a CONNECT tunnel at the HTTP layer to 
transfer the HTTPS (or encrypted non-HTTPS) content through Squid. The 
SNI value, cert altSubjectName, or raw-IP (whichever most-trusted is 
available) received from peek/bump gets used as the Host header on that 
internal CONNECT tunnel.

The Host header forgery check at HTTP layer is performed on that 
HTTP-level CONNECT request regardless of whether a specific SNI-vs-IP 
check was done by the TLS logic. Ideally both layers would do it, but 
SSL-Bump permutations/complexity makes that hard.



&gt;<i> And indeed: if I perform the same test for HTTP traffic, I do see the 
</I>&gt;<i> error message:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> curl <A HREF="http://wordpress.org">http://wordpress.org</A> --connect-to wordpress.org:80:8.8.8.8:80
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that for my use-case (only splice certain domains and prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to a wrong IP address), there's currently no solution then. 
</I>&gt;<i> Squid would also have to perform a similar check as the Host check for 
</I>&gt;<i> the SNI information. Maybe I can perform the same function with an 
</I>&gt;<i> external acl as you've mentioned. I will look into that later. Thanks 
</I>&gt;<i> for your time.
</I>

IIRC there is at least one SSL-Bump permutation which does server name 
vs IP validation (in a way, not explicitly). But that particular code 
path is not always taken and the SSL-Bump logic does not go out of its 
way to lookup missing details. So likely you are just not encountering 
the rare case that SNI gets verified.
