</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've enabled this debug option, but I never see the security alert in

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> currently using Squid 5.5 that comes with Rocky Linux 9.4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The code logging &quot;SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages is present in v5.5, but perhaps it is not triggered in that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version (or even in modern/supported Squids) when I expect it to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> triggered. Unfortunately, there are too many variables for me to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> predict what exactly went wrong in your particular test case without 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing a lot more work (and I cannot volunteer to do that work right now).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at <A HREF="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery,">https://wiki.squid-cache.org/KnowledgeBase/HostHeaderForgery,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> it always seems to mention the Host header. It has no mention of 
</I>&gt;<i> performing the same checks for the SNI value. Since we're peeking at the 
</I>&gt;<i> request, we can't see the actual Host header being sent.
</I>
As Amos has explained, SslBump at step2 is supposed to relay TLS Client 
Hello information via fake CONNECT request headers. SNI should go into 
CONNECT Host header and CONNECT target pseudo-header. That fake CONNECT 
request should then be checked for forgery.

Whether all of the above actually happens is an open question. I bet a 
short answer is &quot;no&quot;. I am not just being extra cautious here based on 
overall poor SslBump code quality! I believe there are &quot;real bugs&quot; on 
that code path because we have fixed some of them (and I hope to find 
the time to post a polished version of those fixes for the official 
review in the foreseeable future). For an example that fuels my 
concerns, see the following unofficial commit message:
<A HREF="https://github.com/measurement-factory/squid/commit/462aedcc">https://github.com/measurement-factory/squid/commit/462aedcc</A>


&gt;<i> I believe that for my use-case (only splice certain domains and prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to a wrong IP address), there's currently no solution then.
</I>
I suspect that there is currently no solution that does not involve 
writing complex external ACL helpers or complex Squid code fixes.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I guess that explains why if I add &quot;%ssl::&lt;cert_subject&quot; to my 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> logformat for the access log, the field is always &quot;-&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may explain that, but other problems may lead to the same &quot;no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate&quot; result as well, of course. You can kind of check by using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stare/bump instead of peek/splice -- if you see certificate details 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logged in that bumping test, then it is more likely that Squid just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not get a plain text certificate in peeking configurations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've updated the configuration to use stare/bump instead. The field is 
</I>&gt;<i> then indeed added to the log file. A curl request that forces the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection to a different IP address then also fails because the 
</I>&gt;<i> certificate isn't valid for the name. There's no mention of the Host 
</I>&gt;<i> header not matching the IP address, but I assume that check comes after 
</I>&gt;<i> the certificate check then.
</I>
In most cases, the forgery check should happen before the certificate 
check. I suspect that it does not happen at all in your test case.


HTH,

Alex.
