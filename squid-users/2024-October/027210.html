The exemption has to be done through the PAC file, because once the 
browser's request reaches the proxy, it's impossible to go back and tell 
browser to go direct.

&gt;<i> The issue is, we don't exactly know how to implement the PAC file on our 
</I>&gt;<i> new Squid box.
</I>
the PAC file has to be provided ideally via HTTP, I'm not sure whether squid 
has that functionality.

I guess a HTTP server was running on your old server, providing the PAC 
file.

&gt;<i> With that said, I agree with your statement that its difficult to 
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshoot an issue as opposed to go around it.  Unfortunately, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> how it was done before and that's the direction our current management is 
</I>&gt;<i> going again.  So I need to reconfigure the squid.conf file to ignore 
</I>&gt;<i> internal traffic, networks, and IP's, and only web filter and proxy 
</I>&gt;<i> internet connections.  We can't just copy the old config because it 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't carry over 1:1, and its an old version from 2.5.
</I>
Once more, you can't ignore squid to be ignored by browsers, because squid 
can only do anything when it's accessed by browsers, when it's already too 
late.  Either browsers must go around the proxy (PAC or WPAD), or the proxy 
must be allowed to reach destination server.

Install apache server to the machine and configure it to serve the PAC&gt;

Amos, are you sure this can work in the case described?

&gt;<i>  # details of how Squid should connect to the device
</I>&gt;<i>  cache_peer 172.27.46.253 parent 4434 0 originserver \
</I>&gt;<i>     tls-cert=/path/to/server.ca
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  # which traffic to relay there
</I>&gt;<i>  acl foo dstdomain foo.example.com
</I>&gt;<i>  cache_peer_access 172.27.46.253 allow foo
</I>&gt;<i>  never_direct allow foo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  # permission for clients to make requests that reach that device
</I>&gt;<i>  http_access allow localnet foo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Add more ACL conditions as needed to restrict the http_access line to 
</I>&gt;<i>the appropriate clients.
