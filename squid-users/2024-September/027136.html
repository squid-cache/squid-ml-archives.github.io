<PRE>Hey Josh,

Configuring Squid is not a simple task in some cases.
I used to think it's a pretty simple piece of software to configure and
indeed with the right background and labs you can achieve specific goals
easily and fast.
However, I encountered over the years enough situations to understand that
it might not be easy for everybody.

This is the main reason that this mailing list exists, if you need help we
are here to try and help you.
I have seen that Amos and Alex gave you suggestions and I hope these helps
you.

If you need more help I will be happy to give you some of my time via zoom
and to see and try to understand better the scenario and the issues.

Yours,
Eliezer

Antony, 

So those two rules were definitely not the way to go, thank you to those who
clarified that to me. 

I'll remove them. 

This is really frustrating. I've been trying to get a working Squid
configuration for weeks now and it is literally a 5 minute process for most
people. 

I'll keep looking and see what else could be blocking traffic.

&gt;<i> How I understand the rules are as follows:

</I>
No; firstly the &quot;localnet&quot; ACL is defined by *source* address, therefore
&quot;localnet&quot; matches traffic *from* your local network.

Secondly the ! negates this, therefore &quot;!localnet&quot; matches any source
address which is *not* in your local network.

Therefore &quot;http_access deny !localnet&quot; denies any access from an address not
in your local network.

&gt;<i> &gt; http_access allow localnet
</I>
This then allows access from any address which *is* in your local network.

Now, having matched all traffic not from your local network, and all traffic
which is from your local network, you have accounted for all possible
traffic, therefore any other rules have no effect.


Hope this helps,


Antony.
