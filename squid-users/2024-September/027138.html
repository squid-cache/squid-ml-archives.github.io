<PRE>Eliezer, 

Thank you for the response. 

I was admittedly at my wits end yesterday and I felt like I keep going in circles. 

We found something on our old Squid box that looks like it may have been used by the old system to assist. I'll reach back out when I have a better question than &quot;why can't I get this to work?&quot;

Thank you, 
Josh

Hey Josh,

Configuring Squid is not a simple task in some cases.
I used to think it's a pretty simple piece of software to configure and indeed with the right background and labs you can achieve specific goals easily and fast.
However, I encountered over the years enough situations to understand that it might not be easy for everybody.

This is the main reason that this mailing list exists, if you need help we are here to try and help you.
I have seen that Amos and Alex gave you suggestions and I hope these helps you.

If you need more help I will be happy to give you some of my time via zoom and to see and try to understand better the scenario and the issues.

Yours,
Eliezer

Antony,

So those two rules were definitely not the way to go, thank you to those who clarified that to me.

I'll remove them.

This is really frustrating. I've been trying to get a working Squid configuration for weeks now and it is literally a 5 minute process for most people.

I'll keep looking and see what else could be blocking traffic.

&gt;<i> How I understand the rules are as follows:

</I>
No; firstly the &quot;localnet&quot; ACL is defined by *source* address, therefore &quot;localnet&quot; matches traffic *from* your local network.

Secondly the ! negates this, therefore &quot;!localnet&quot; matches any source address which is *not* in your local network.

Therefore &quot;http_access deny !localnet&quot; denies any access from an address not in your local network.

&gt;<i> &gt; http_access allow localnet
</I>
This then allows access from any address which *is* in your local network.

Now, having matched all traffic not from your local network, and all traffic which is from your local network, you have accounted for all possible traffic, therefore any other rules have no effect.


Hope this helps,


Antony.
