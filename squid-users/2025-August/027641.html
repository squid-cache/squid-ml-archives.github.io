I'm not sure I would call that research exactly. It is pretty much an 
enumeration of theoretical flaws in HTTP/1 which **might** occur 
assuming one of the HTTP agents is designed badly.

I notice that proper implementation of HTTP security requirements closes 
off a number of issues listed there.

For example; all mentioned issues with &quot;obs-fold&quot; (obsolete HTTP/1.0 
whitespace folding) in Content-Length headers are not a problem when one 
obeys the RFC7230 / RFC9112 requirement to either; replace obs-fold with 
a single SP **before** processing the headers, OR to respond with a 
connection error (404 status response and TCP RST) whenever it is 
received on HTTP/1.1 messages.


&gt;<i> And was wondering how squid is handling such cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
AFAICS, Squid has been around and been updated with workarounds and 
fixes for all of these cases (and many more pre-RFC9112 issues) as they 
were discovered.

Today Squid has a rather strict parsing of input, with our &quot;lenient&quot; 
mode only tolerating the broken inputs when they are able to be fixed 
without causing more issues and essentially no behavior change.


Not sure I would go as far as the &quot;must die&quot; argument quite yet. The 
HTTP/1 syntax still has a place as Human-readable display for any HTTP 
version. But yes, that time to stop sending it in communications is fast 
approaching. HTTP/2 had its 10 year birthday earlier this year!
