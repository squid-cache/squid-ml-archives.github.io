It was an attempt to implement the pipeline mechanism of HTTP/1.1
see &lt;<A HREF="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#pipelining">https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#pipelining</A>&gt;


FYI; very few people have even considered turning it on. So do not be 
surprised if you do not get a response to your more detailed questions 
about its behaviour in current Squid.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> what is a good solid go go juice number for pipeline_prefetch? I do notice massive increases in facebook loads when I have it at 100 however decreased performance with news websites. It is like a can&#8217;t win directive for me. Finally I thought best to ask.

IMO the answer to that depends on your proxy traffic.

  * A server that is able to produce responses very fast, operating over 
a long-delay connection can benefit from requests being sent in a pipeline.

  * As can two proxies communicating over a multiplexed, fast, **and** 
reliable connection.


Most situations risk adding what is called Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking 
delays for the pipelined requests. HTTP/2 was created to solve that 
problem and does far better.


&gt;<i> I do understand it is no longer recommended to be used this is simply for speed and the system is secure behind a firewall.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Firewall existence and security are not relevant to pipeline_prefetch.

Pipeline as implemented by Squid is only of much benefit when you 
already have a high speed situation. As mentioned above.

The primary use-case of Squid pipeline_prefetch to my knowledge was for 
the cache_peer links on proxies acting as accelerators on either end of 
a geosync satellite communication link. Servicing international level 
traffic relay for military outposts or small(ish) national teleco's.
   The primary factor being very long-distance / high-lag TCP links.


Cheers
Amos
