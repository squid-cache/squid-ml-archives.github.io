<PRE>Sorry I had my iPhone do a voice to text, I do not understand how a Tesla can drive so well but voice to text looks wrong. 

After trying every setting inside of Squid I thought I should ask I have 4bg ram and 128GB M.2 SSD onboard disk I am using a NVMe secondary Intel Optane M.2 drive for my cache. 

What is a good recommendation for Hard Drive Cache System I use UFS but AUFS inside of the Squid definitive guide says it is way faster like formula one versus UFS the options I have are UFS AUFS DISKD, I have 16 Level 1 directories my memory replacement policy is LRU for memory cache it seems to run better with that, my options for memory replacement policy are HEAP GDSF I assume any HEAP will require more memory, HEAP LFUDF, HEAP LRU and just LRU. I also have a Cache Replacement policy with the same options I have it set to Heap LFUDA that is the default. Squid Memory cache Size I have set to default 64MB with max object size 256kb for the memory, for disk I have 256GB available I only have it set to 32000MB or 3.2GB for fear of overloading the RAM when it fills up. 

for level 1 directories I can have 4,8,16,32,64,128,256 each layer one containers 256 sub directories so this could hog memory if you did 
256*256=65,536 I imagine not ok with only 4GB I have onboard memory I can&#8217;t make it any bigger. I use this with SSL intercept it does cache and works well I just want to get rid of the lag on news websites. 

rewrite process children I have it set max 25  with process children startup at 12 and idle at 8 
SSL certificate deamon children I have it set to start 10 

it runs well I have tried many different things as you know from all the emails, I am sorry it is the most fascinating software to me. Code that runs as fast as the internet. Is there any thing I can do to make it go faster? Some website have a lag fox news yahoo only do on the SSL intercept devices the splice devices never have any issues, its lighting fast for them. I thought I should finally ask after 4-5 years of doing changes. I have got it to work as fast as I can on my own, time to ask the community. 

Thanks again sorry for the weird email before.

</I>&gt;<i> I have tried every setting from 256 level one folders to 32 to 16 every different type of memory catch types all the memory types schemes were using and I just can&#8217;t seem to find one that is performance wise the best so I thought After many years of trying that I should just email you guys .
