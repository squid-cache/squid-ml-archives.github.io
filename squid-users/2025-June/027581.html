&quot;intercept&quot; (NAT Interception) uses NAT systems to change the 
destination IP:port on TCP packets sent by the client, such that they 
are delivered to a listening IP:port of some process on the local machine.

&quot;tproxy&quot; (Transparent Proxy) uses the Linux iptables feature called 
&quot;TPROXY&quot; (on BSD the PF feature is called &quot;divert&quot;) to deliver TCP 
packets sent by the client to some process no the local machine.


&gt;<i>&#160; i believe transparent requires that the 
</I>&gt;<i> NAT'ing be done &quot;on-box&quot; as opposed to across the network by my router.
</I>
They both do.


&gt;<i> is this accurate?&#160; are there any other differences?
</I>
NAT erases the original IP:port details the client sent to. Squid using 
NAT intercept will use the Squid machine IP as sender/source-IP on 
traffic to upstream servers.

Squid using TPROXY will preserve the client source-IP on traffic to 
upstream servers. This requires special care with routing for the 
intercepted traffic handling not to loose/drop packets.


&gt;<i>&#160; which is the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate mechanism for my use case?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  * TPROXY is &quot;The Right Way&quot; - but complex.

  * NAT is more popular due to admin already being familiar with 
configuring those systems.

Your choice.



&gt;<i> the connection chain would look something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> client -&gt; router (DNAT to VIP) -&gt; haproxy VIP (port 3129, SNAT to VIP 
</I>&gt;<i> IP) -&gt; squid (port 3129) -&gt; internet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No. Interception is the mechanism by which client-&gt;server traffic is 
converted into client-&gt;proxy.

Only the **first** proxy on your hierarchy received the intercepted TCP 
connections. That would be your HAProxy.

client -&gt; router -&gt; haproxy -&gt; squid -&gt; router -&gt; Internet

On router:
  route src-IP=clients + dst-port=80 to gateway VIP1
  route src-IP=VIP2 + dst-port=80 to gateway Internet

On haproxy machine (VIP1):
  iptables DNAT port 80 to port 3129

On Squid machine (VIP2):
  regular forward proxy configuration. Nothing special needed.
