Hi,

I just thought I'd give 3.5.0.2 a workout and so far it seems to be
working fine. One minor nit I found was on the initial page of
cachemgr.cgi: the &quot;server&quot; field now contains two blank lines, whereas
previously it would always contain only the (correct) localhost.

After some digging the reason seems simple enough: the cachemgr.conf
by default contains two empty lines which are blindly added as
form input values.

Removing those two empty lines (or replacing them with comments)
only leaves the default &quot;localhost&quot; in place, just like before.

Hope that helps. :)

Thanks for squid!
